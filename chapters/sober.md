Russell and Stacy blasted until they were out of ammo. The palace grounds were littered with the tangled corpses of black-clad paramilitaries, variously missing limbs and riddled with massive holes. In the end, though, there were just too many of them.

Russell clicked his trigger uselessly as the masked combatants marched up the stairs towards them. "Damn. Did you save any rounds for us?" he asked.

"Nope. Empty," Stacy responded.

Russell looked over the parapet at the moat below. Not nearly high enough to guarantee death on impact. "Got a knife?" he asked.

"Nope."

"I guess this is it, then."

"Looks like it."

"Sorry for dragging you into this."

"No worries, mate."

Russell looked at his old friend and forced a weak smile. She reciprocated. He remembered how they'd first met, all those years ago in the diner. How he'd been too nervous to meet her eyes. He remembered how he'd looked down on her for being a social media influencer, and how wrong he'd been. Then, the years of friendship, the bitter disputes, the fierce loyalty up to the very end. His heart broke for her.

A rough voice interrupted his thoughts. "Down on your knees, hands on your head!" The paramilitaries had arrived.

Russell and Stacy sank to their knees and complied. The masked men zip-tied their hands behind their backs, and threw hoods over their heads.

Blackness.

The two ketzels landed in a clearing in the woods a few kilometers away. Vincent and Xavier hadn't had time to put their headsets on, and were thus unable to communicate a plan in mid-air. Vincent spoke first.

"I'm not keen to fly over the blockade again," he said.

"I'm not keen to be here when they find out Stacy's dead," Xavier responded. "The entire Dominion's about to be crawling with jackbooted thugs. We need to get home, pronto."

Vincent nodded. It was a sober assessment of the situation.

"They won't shoot you," Filbert volunteered. "Probably. The blockade's about stopping supplies from getting in. No one cares about people leaving."

"Would you bet your life on it?" asked Vincent.

"No. I'm staying here," he responded.

Stacy II exploded. "The hell you are! You absolute useless wanker! My mom could have been on that ketzel. In fact, my mom could have been sitting at home, with the rest of my family, all happy and together and not dead at all, like we were before you and your stupid dad showed up!" She picked up a rock and lobbed it at Filbert.

"Ow!" he yelped.

Finding this cathartic, Stacy II continued to pelt Filbert with rocks, which he unsuccessfully attempted to block. Vincent and Xavier looked on, neutrally. The young lady had been through a lot.

When she was done, she sank onto the ground, wrapped her arms around her knees, and sobbed. The three men watched, nonplussed.

After a minute, she stood up, bearing the expression of a jilted woman about to murder her cheating spouse. "I'm not going to the Anarchy," she announced. "I'm going to put this right. And you" - she pointed at Filbert - "are going to man the hell up and help me."

"What are you going to do?" asked Vincent.

"Take back the Dominion," she responded, unspecifically.

"Can we help?" he asked.

"No. You two need to prepare the Anarchy for war. Now that the PR's gotten an appetite for spreading democracy, it's only a matter of time."

Vincent nodded. Once again, a sober assessment. These teenagers were starting to impress him.

"Actually," Stacy II added, "can I borrow Cosmo?"

Xavier bit his lip. Cosmo was his best friend. He had hatched him from an egg before he could tie his shoes, and barely remembered a time before they'd been together.

"Sure," he responded. "But bring him back alive."

"Thanks," responded Stacy II and gave him a hug. Then, glaring at Filbert, she picked up her railgun and strode backwards towards the ketzel. "Hey loser! You coming or what?" she taunted.

The bruised and defeated Filbert looked at Xavier and Vincent. Vincent just crossed his arms and nodded. Xavier pointed his chin towards Cosmo, wordlessly. Filbert sighed, picked up his railgun, and trudged after her.
