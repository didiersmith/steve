## 0. Statist Infiltrators

"The boys are all obsessed with their physics project," Stacy II's mom complained into her head. "Honestly, sometimes it feels like Steve doesn't even care that you won't make it to our afterlife."

"What?" Stacy II asked.

"You mean you didn't know?" her mom replied. "Steve's in debt. Your souls are some sort of weird collateral. Don't ask me how it works, it's all over my head. All I know is, if you don't regain control of the TD and get people to start worshipping Steve again, your soul goes to Allen when you die."

"Who's Allen?"

Stacy II's mom explained. She shrieked. Filbert looked at her weirdly.

After their escape from the Anarcho-Cannibalist village, they'd dropped Archie back home and taken the boat to the southernmost island in The Anarchy. From there, they'd been picked up by The Terrarium and were presently sitting in the grass, flying over the South Pacific to Antarctica.

"That's assuming that they even still care about aligned souls at all," Stacy II's mom added. "The guy bankrolling all this, Murdoch, seems more interested in using your world as some sort of tech incubator. If you don't start delivering useful, aligned interstellar warriors...Do you know what happens to projects that don't deliver return on investment?"

"They get canned," Stacy II thought. "But what do you want me to do? I already tried to align people. Didn't you see what happened on New Australia?"

"Well yeah," her mom replied. "Obviously you weren't going to be able to align _them_. Why do you think I banished them in the first place? Also, I don't think it helped that they hated you."

"Thanks, mom. I appreciate the encouragement. Do you have any actual advice?"

"Yes. Keep your pearls away from the swine."

"Thanks mom, I hadn't heard that one before. Anything else?"

"You can't just convert people at the barrel of a railgun. It doesn't stick. You have to win their hearts and minds."

Filbert chose that moment to spring to his feet and run to the window. "Look!" he shouted excitedly, pointing in the distance. "Land!"

The sun reflected off a glimmering white ice sheet in the distance. Stacy II's heart beat rapidly and she began to sweat. Although she'd mostly enjoyed her day-to-day experience living with Anarchists on New Australia, she was wary of the fact that they'd been unable to scale past a hundred people before resorting to an institutionalized cannibalism-based justice system. What horrors would a society of millions of ungoverned people inflict on each other? Still, Vincent and Xavier had seemed fairly normal. But Curtis had seemed normal too, right up to the point where he'd sentenced her friend to be roasted and eaten.

"You'll be fine," her mom reassured her. "Vincent's Anarchy is totally different from Curtis's. These are _elite human capital_, don't you know."

Stacy II cringed. The phrase 'human capital" brought up unpleasant memories from New Australia. "If they're so elite, why do they live on a block of ice in the middle of nowhere?" she asked.

Her mom laughed. "You're right, a true elite would have rallied the troops and sank the People's Republic back into the sea."

Eventually, the Transactic Mountains appeared in the distance. The Terrarium began ascending to clear the mountains.

"Where will we find Xavier?" Stacy II asked her mom.

"Xavier? Don't you mean your dad? And your brothers and sisters?"

"Oh," she blushed. "Yeah, that's what I meant."

"Don't lie to me. I can read your mind."

"Their names are right next to each other."

"Save it."

"Okay, fine, where's Xavier?"

"In space."

"What?"

"Long story. Boys, you know."

Antarctica was busy. Far busier than she had expected. Millions of people had fled their anchorages, relocating beyond the reaches of the Commonwealth Navy to the icy interior of the final continent. The original valley was now a bustling metropolis, filled with buildings and office workers, connected via heated tunnels to the surrounding suburbs.

She and Filbert spent the next several days reconnecting with old contacts. Many, like her own family, had fled the Theocratic Dominion during the revolution. To her relief, none of them attempted to convince her to eat anyone. Unfortunately, despite being armed to the teeth, none of them wanted to re-take the Commonwealth either.

"What did you expect?" asked Filbert. "Their roots in the Commonwealth only go back twenty one years, maximum. Hardly worth dying for. Also, one of the founding principles of the Anarchy is that you should just move away from people you don't like."

"Running away as a founding principle? How has that played out?"

Filbert kept his mouth shut and waited for her to answer her own question.

"Let's have a look, shall we? Oh yeah! They're cowering under domes in the least hospitable part of the planet! If only they stood and fought, they wouldn't have to live like this."

Filbert shrugged. "It's temporary. They're moving to space. Why would they want to go back to the ocean?"

Stacy II growled with frustration. "God damn it! Why is it so hard? All I want is to raise an army and reclaim my rightful throne. Is that really so much to ask?"

Filbert continued his policy of silence.

"It's been a year, and I have nothing to show for it. How did all the great English kings do it?"

"I think they paid the soldiers, for starters."

"I'm broke."

"Life coaching isn't profitable enough?"

"You just don't know when to shut up, do you?"

They stopped at a stall where a man with a cart full of oranges and a lever-action juice press was dishing out cups of freshly-squeezed orange juice for two silverbacks apiece. Stacy II dug in her purse for the banknotes, each of which contained a tiny piece of silver in a small transparent window in the center.

"Two, please," she requested and handed over the notes.

She looked around as the man set about slicing and squeezing the oranges with machine-like efficiency. The valley was an impressive sight. Rather than glass and steel, the Anarchists had chosen to construct their buildings from stone - shamelessly copying the arches, vibrant facades, and terracotta roof tiles of Central American colonial architecture. Palm trees lined the wide, cobblestone streets, and above them all, the sun reflected off the towering white peaks and glinted as it refracted through the colossal glass dome. Activity was everywhere - people of all ages bustled through the streets or sat on terraces, laughing and enjoying food and coffee, while robots mined carbon and executed enormous construction projects in the mountains beyond.

Given the choice, she thought, she probably wouldn't want to go back to the Commonwealth either.

"It's just so annoying," she continued griping. "My mom had it running perfectly. Millions of people. All aligned. Breeding like rabbits. And then the PR had to just come around and cock it all up!"

The juice vendor cocked his head as he handed over her juice-filled paper cup. "Was your mom Queen Stacy?" he asked.

Stacy II froze and examined the man. He wasn't anyone she recognized. "Yes, did you know her?" she responded.

"Only by reputation," he replied. "I was never a TD man, myself. But everyone knows who Queen Stacy was. My condolences, by the way."

"Thanks."

"The TD's gone to hell since she died."

"I know."

"You should probably do something about that."

"Oh? First time I've heard that one. I'll get on it as soon as my life coaching business IPOs."

The juice vendor laughed and began halving oranges for Filbert's drink. As he placed the first half into the press, he furrowed his brow as if he'd just remembered something. "Do you know that Xavier has the guy who did it locked away somewhere?" he asked.

"The guy who did what?"

"The guy who organized the revolt. Some sort of statist mastermind. He sentenced your mom to death. He also tried to take the Terrarium at one point, and killed Vincent in the process. Not a very popular guy round here."

"Where is he?"

"Beats me. If anyone knew, he'd probably be stoned to death."

Stacy II thanked the vendor and walked away, mulling over this newfound information. Finally, a lead! Her mind was a wrestling match between emotion and logic. On the one hand, the deep, primordial regions of her soul ached to find the man responsible for her mother's death and torture him - crucifying him to office furniture and throwing darts at him until he begged for death. On the other hand, she could use the help of a 'statist mastermind', particularly one who understood the inner workings of the PR.

Dragging a protesting Filbert down the street, she quieted her mind enough to form a coherent internal monologue and summoned her mom.

Her mom gave up on the search almost immediately, and handed the problem over to Russell.

"You need to give me more to go on than that," Russell explained. "'Xavier's prisoner, who sentenced Stacy to death and also briefly invaded the Terrarium' isn't a valid search term."

"What more do you want?" Stacy II asked. For an alleged genius, Russell was having an awful lot of trouble executing a simple search.

"The search engine only takes descriptions of their present state. I can filter by their name, height, weight, etc."

"He's presently Xavier's prisoner! How many prisoners could Xavier possibly have?"

"'Prisoner' isn't an objective term. As far as StevieNix is concerned, he could just be a guest in a room with bars on the windows."

"Okay! Find me all men in Antarctica alone in rooms with bars on the windows!"

Russell was silent for a moment as he tapped at his keyboard, before responding, "Nothing."

"All men in Antarctica alone in basements!"

Another pause, followed by "Thirty eight results. I guess basements are popular places to hang out."

"Xavier's basement!"

"Right. Hang on."

Russell paused again, while Stacy II grimaced, meticulously tore strips off her empty paper cup, and tried to keep her mental Tourrette's syndrome from offending Russell in her impatience. Filbert watched her, nervously.

"One result. Good search query! You see? How hard was that?"

Stacy II grumbled and tried to heave her train of thought from annoyance to gratitude.

"Hang on!" Russell exclaimed. "I recognize this dickhead. What are you planning on doing with him?"

"Hadn't decided yet. Why?"

"He tortured me to death. Ripped off all my fingernails and made me listen to Hip to be Square by Huey Lewis and The News on repeat."

"Wow," Stacy II replied. "So he killed all three of you? Funny. I was thinking of torturing him to death too."

"Have at it. He's in Xavier's basement. I'll walk you there."

Stacy II picked up the pieces of her discarded pieces of paper cup, and grabbed Filbert's arm.

"Let's go," she said. "Your dad found him. He says he'll help us...get inquisitive on him."

Allen leaned back in his chair and chuckled. Messing with these AIs was the most fun he'd had in...goodness, in as long as he could remember.

Things had gotten a little slow since Murdoch's wunderkind had locked his favourite player in a basement, but all it took was a well-timed conversation with an orange juice vendor, and things were moving again.

Sure, Steve's stupid little New Sealand project was covered in poop and practically over. But the islands were still floating and he still had a couple decent players. He wouldn't rest until the islands were sunk to the bottom of the ocean and Steve's players were all his, for all time. He'd make that ineffectual little academic regret even crossing him.

He smiled and watched as Stacy II and Filbert crossed the town to Xavier's mostly deserted house.
