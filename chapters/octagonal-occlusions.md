## 0. Octagonal Occlusions

"Is that what a Dyson sphere looks like?" Stacy asked. "I was expecting it to look...I dunno. Different."

"More like a vacuum cleaner?" Russell asked.

Stacy tutted and turned back to the window. "Seriously," she said. "Come check it out."

Russell was still groggy from his six weeks' hibernation. He floated to the window and squinted out at the spot where Stacy was pointing.

"I don't see anything," he said.

"Zoom in."

He always forgot that his monkeybot could do that. Focusing on the spot, he zoomed his vision in.

"Whoa," he said.

As he dialled in his focus, he saw what she meant. It looked like a circular window which had been mostly covered up with tiny octagonal stickers. Faint rays of light shone through the cracks, like a piece of abstract art by someone who loved geometry.

"That's not a vacuum cleaner," he said.

"Did they papier-mâché over the star?" Stacy mused.

Russell didn't answer. He was too busy studying the bizarre shape that was covering Sirius.

Some time later, Russell broke the silence again. "It isn't one structure," he concluded. "It's thousands of little ones. Maybe millions."

"How do you know?" Stacy asked.

"The patterns change," he replied. The big octagons move faster than the little ones. I think it's all orbiting solar panels."

Stacy nodded.

"We'll see soon enough," she said.

Just then, a red light started flashing on the ceiling and a klaxon started blaring. "Burn down in sixty seconds," a robotic voice announced. "Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts."

Russell looked at Stacy and forced a weak smile. "Guess we will," he replied.

He clipped into his harness and gripped the straps as the robotic voice counted down. He clamped his eyes shut as the count reached the final ten seconds and the ship began to rotate. Finally the count hit zero. The fusion rocket ignited, and he was crushed into his chair.

"Burning down" the robotic voice announced. "Thirty-six hours remaining."

He tried to say something to Stacy, but his mechanical diaphragm wouldn't move. In fact, nothing could move. His entire body felt like it was being squashed by a hydraulic press, and the ship itself shuddered and creaked under the enormous force. He'd been warned that deceleration would be brutal, but this was something else.

To any sentient life surrounding Sirius, the nuclear exhaust from the fusion engine would look like a new star had appeared in the sky. The harder they decelerated, the less time the life would have to react - Vincent and Xavier had thus chosen the hardest deceleration they could manage without the ship coming apart. His comfort, he surmised, had not been part of the equation.

The next thirty-six hours would suck.
