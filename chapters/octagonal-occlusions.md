## 0. Octagonal Occlusions

"That's not a Dyson sphere," Russell remarked. "That's...I have no idea."

Stacy was still groggy from her six weeks' hibernation. She squinted out the window at the spot where Russell was pointing.

"I don't see anything," she said.

"Zoom in," Russell advised.

Stacy always forgot that her monkeybot could do that. Focusing on the spot, she zoomed her vision in.

"Whoa," she said.

As she dialled in her focus, she saw what he meant. It looked like a circular window which had been mostly covered up with tiny octagonal stickers. Faint rays of light shone through the cracks, like a piece of abstract art by someone who loved geometry.

"Did they papier-mâché over the star?" she mused.

Russell didn't answer. He was too busy studying the bizarre shape that was covering Sirius.

Some time later, Russell broke the silence again. "It isn't one structure," he mused. "It's thousands of little ones. Maybe millions."

"How do you know?" Stacy asked.

"The patterns change," he replied. The big octagons move faster than the little ones. I think it's all orbiting solar panels."

Stacy nodded. Orbiting solar panels made sense, sort of.

"We'll see soon enough," she said.

Just then, a red light started flashing on the ceiling and a klaxon started blaring. "Burn down in sixty seconds," a robotic voice announced. "Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts."

Russell looked at Stacy and forced a weak smile. "Guess we will," he replied.

Stacy clipped into her harness and gripped the straps as the robotic voice counted down. She clamped her eyes shut as the count reached the final ten seconds and the ship began to rotate. Finally the count hit zero. The fusion rocket ignited, and she was crushed into her chair.

"Burning down" the robotic voice announced. "Thirty-six hours remaining."

She tried to say something to Russell, but her mechanical diaphragm wouldn't move. In fact, nothing could move. Her entire body felt like it was being squashed by a hydraulic press, and the ship itself shuddered and creaked under the enormous force. She'd been warned that deceleration would be brutal, but this was something else.

To any sentient life surrounding Sirius, the nuclear exhaust from the fusion engine would look like a new star had appeared in the sky. The harder they decelerated, the less time the life would have to react - Steve and Vincent had thus chosen the hardest deceleration they could manage without the ship coming apart. Her comfort, she surmised, had not been part of the equation.

The next thirty-six hours would suck.
