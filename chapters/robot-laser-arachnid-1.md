## 0. Robot Laser Arachnid 1

What a great day. The sun was shining. The monkeybot team had cleared a hurdle. The fiscal quarter was off to a strong start. And Murdoch had a new friend.

Well, "friend."

He prepared his breakfast by pouring a tumbler of whiskey and lighting a cigarette, and jacked in to StevieNix to chat with his "friend."

"You need a sintering head," he told him. "How are you going to make anything cool without sintering?"

He sat back and watched as Vincent processed his thought. Vincent was the ultimate embodiment of his individualist innovator meme. Murdoch had specifically selected him for Steve's intervention, and so far, that choice was looking solid.

Vincent picked up his phone and spoke into the LLM-app that one of the other apes - Russell - had written. "I need a selective laser sintering head," he said.

Murdoch chuckled. Playable characters were hilarious - the ape probably thought the laser was his own idea. Just a total lack of self-awareness.

"Certainly!" replied the LLM. "What materials will you need to sinter?"

"All the common metals. Copper, aluminium, steel, tungsten, titanium."

"This is what we collected the industrial printer for. I must advise you, even though this is quite a powerful laser by printer standards, it will be quite slow at sintering."

"That's okay, tell me where to find it."

Murdoch watched as the LLM instructed Vincent exactly where he could find the printer, and how he might disassemble and rearrange the parts to produce a laser hot enough to fuse metal. The ape had spent the last few days driving around every junkyard in Perth, collecting e-waste. Now, he was in his garage, acting as the hands of the omniscient chatbot, desoldering surface-mounted devices and welding stuff together. It was quite the show.

As the morning progressed, Vincent's Frankensteinian robot began to take form. It looked like a huge mechanical spider. Murdoch tapped the ash off the end of his cigarette and leaned in for a closer look.

The spider's body was roughly the size and shape of a desktop computer. It was able to support itself on as few as three of its eight hinged limbs, while using its remaining five to manipulate objects and tools. It was equipped with every tool necessary to manufacture itself, and more - its blocky body contained a heat gun, a 3D printer head, a router, lasers, power tools, a welding torch...

Every inch of the body not filled with tools was crammed full of electronics - salvaged circuit boards, GPUs and microcontrollers, all wired together in an incomprehensible warren of wires and fibre optics. From what Murdoch could tell, the software - the most complex part of the entire construction - had almost no human involvement in its creation whatsoever. Vincent simply prompted the LLM to generate the appropriate firmware, flashed the resultant machine code onto the robot's various computers, and prayed.

Murdoch didn't answer Vincent's prayers. He had no clue if the software would work, and wasn't interested in watching Vincent debug it. Instead, he went down the hall and asked Steve to fast-forward the sim for a bit.

"Just set a breakpoint on whenever the robot starts moving," he said. "Run it full-tilt until then."

Breakpoint. He was down with the lingo. He'd learned a thing or two, watching Steve work on StevieNix all these months - why was Steve looking at him like he'd asked him to murder a cat?

"_Just_ set a breakpoint?" Steve asked. "Sure, I'll _just_ do that. Easiest thing in the world."

Programmers, honestly.

Steve clicked around some incomprehensible window, hit enter, and the sim sped up. The screen flickered as days and nights passed in seconds. A few moments later, it paused completely.

"Breakpoint," Steve said, pointing at a corner of the screen.

Well, how hard was that?

"Is it ready?" Murdoch asked.

"Looks like it."

"How much time has passed?"

Steve brought up another incomprehensible screen. "A few weeks."

"Okay," Murdoch said. "Not bad. Take it back down to normal speed and resume the sim. Thanks!"

Steve grumbled and returned to whatever nerd activities he had been doing beforehand. Murdoch made a mental note to figure out how to fast-forward to a breakpoint by himself. Not that he disliked managing Steve, just...it's good to be self-reliant.

He returned to his office and sat down at his desk to watch the show.

The robot spider was standing up, proudly and symmetrically, on its eight limbs. Status LEDs flashed green. The whine of cooling fans played out through Murdoch's desktop speakers. Vincent was looking...haggard.

Vincent picked up his phone and brought the microphone to his mouth. "Make it fabricate a plywood smiley face, 50mm in diameter," he told the LLM.

Showtime. The robot scuttled across the workbench, bowed its articulated carbon fiber legs and leapt...into the trash can?

Huh.

The trash can moved and almost tipped over. The robot spider climbed out, carrying a scrap piece of plywood, and vaulted back onto the workbench. It put the plywood down, reached into itself to pull out a...Murdoch squinted at the screen...laser, and started etching.

Bright red light filled the garage. Vincent shielded his eyes and Murdoch clicked and dragged on the screen to get a better view of the plywood. Pointless. There was smoke everywhere.

The robot swapped the laser out for a router and pulled a dust extractor hose down from the ceiling. Murdoch's speakers wailed with the combined noise of the cooling fans, dust extractor and router. He reached over and turned them off as the robot started cutting.

The entire process was done in under ten seconds. The robot scuttled away from its workpiece, and Vincent edged forward to inspect the plywood. Murdoch turned his speakers back on and zoomed in.

On the workbench, was a precise 50mm diameter circle, smoke still rising from the laser-engraved smiley face.

Wow. Not bad, robot.

"Holy moly," said Vincent. He brought his phone up to his mouth. "Make it fabricate a remote control toy car."

Murdoch raised an eyebrow. From a piece of wood, to a car. Okay there, ape.

Within two minutes, a maniacally laughing Vincent, newly fabricated remote control in his hands, was driving a miniature cobbled-together car around his garage.

Well then. Hadn't expected that to work.

Murdoch leaned back in his chair and exhaled deeply. Feck, this islander was smart. He reminded him of himself - back in the early days, before Elba.

The ape actually done it - fully automated manufacturing. This was the tipping point. Smooth sailing from here, and still plenty of time left in the quarter. Thanks, monkey.

Time to celebrate. He picked up his cigarette box and tapped out a fag. What a day.
