## 0. Robot Laser Arachnid 1

Murdoch was in a good mood. The sun was shining. The monkeybot team had cleared a hurdle. And he had a new friend. He celebrated with a glass of whiskey and a cigarette, before jacking in to StevieNix to chat with his friend.

"You need a sintering head," he said. "How are you going to make anything cool without sintering?"

He sat back and watched as Vincent processed his thought.

Vincent was the ultimate embodiment of his individualist innovator meme. Murdoch was pretty sure he was a direct descendant of the guy he'd convinced to evict his kid, so many centuries ago. He wondered how old Vincent had been when he had been kicked out of his parents' house. Probably twelve.

The ape picked up his phone and spoke into it. "I need a selective laser sintering head," he said.

Murdoch chuckled. Playable characters were hilarious. He'd never get bored of this.

"Certainly!" replied Russell's LLM. "What materials will you need to sinter?"

"All the common metals. Copper, aluminium, steel, tungsten, titanium."

"This is what we collected the industrial printer for. I must advise you, even though this is quite a powerful laser by printer standards, it will be quite slow at sintering."

"That's okay, tell me where to find it."

Murdoch watched as the LLM instructed Vincent exactly where he could find the printer, and how he might disassemble and rearrange the parts to produce a laser hot enough to fuse metal. The ape had spent the last few days driving around every junkyard in Perth, collecting e-waste. Now, he was in his garage, acting as the hands of the omniscient chatbot, desoldering surface-mounted devices and welding stuff together. It was quite the show. Difficult, at times, to tell who was running it.

Eventually, Vincent's Frankensteinian robot began to take form. It looked like a huge mechanical spider. Murdoch leaned in for a closer look.

The spider's body was roughly the size and shape of a desktop computer. It was able to support itself on as few as three of its eight hinged limbs, while it used its remaining five to manipulate objects and tools. It was equipped with every tool necessary to manufacture itself, and more - its blocky body contained a heat gun, pliers, a 3D printer head, a router with a selection of endmills, a soldering iron, an assortment of lasers, a selection of power tools, and a TIG welding torch.

On top of its body, it held hoppers of sintering powder and spools of ABS plastic, solder, and welding wire. A power cable and an ethernet cable ran from it to the ceiling, where they dangled from a large, hinged arm that Vincent had designed to follow the robot's movements around the garage. On the robot's side were an array of ports, to which the robot could attach various hoses for compressed air, argon gas, and a dust extractor.

It was covered in cameras. There were ten mounted on the body alone, and one or two on each of its eight limbs, ensuring that it always had full view from every angle of any object it was manipulating.

Murdoch was surprised at the cameras. Why would the robot need to see anything? Surely, the omniscient computer could just tell it what to do. But as he listened in on Vincent's internal monologue, it started to make sense: Communication to the MHI-10 still went through the terrestrial internet. For speed and reliability, the robot's computation had to be self-contained.

Every inch of the body not filled with tools was thus crammed full of electronics - salvaged circuit boards, GPUs and microcontrollers, all wired together in an incomprehensible warren of wires and fiber optics that made sense only to the LLM. The software - the most complex part of the entire construction - had almost no human involvement in its creation whatsoever. Vincent simply prompted the LLM to generate the appropriate firmware, flashed the resultant machine code onto the robot's various computers, and prayed.

Murdoch didn't answer Vincent's prayers. He had even less clue if the software would work.

Eventually, after weeks of labour, the robot was ready. The God and the ape watched with trepidation as it booted up.

The robot spider stood up, proudly and symmetrically, on its eight limbs. Status LEDs flashed green. The previously silent garage was filled with the whine of cooling fans.

Vincent picked up his phone and brought the microphone to his mouth. "Make it fabricate a plywood smiley face, 50mm in diameter", he said.

At once, the robot leapt into action. Ignoring the corner of the workshop where Vincent kept his plywood stock, it scuttled past him to the trash can and dove in. It emerged a moment later, almost tipping over the trash can, holding a rough plywood offcut. Elegantly vaulting up onto his workbench, the robot maneuvered the plywood piece directly underneath itself, clamped it in place with three of its limbs, and pulled a laser out from its body. Vincent barely had time to shield his eyes before a bright red light flashed, and smoke began to rise from the plywood. Then, without moving its body or the piece of wood, the robot reached one limb above itself, grabbed the dust extractor hose, plugged it into itself, and turned the extractor on. Finally, it swapped out the laser for the router, and, sequentially moving its "clamping" legs out of the way, started cutting the wood.

The entire process was done in under ten seconds. The robot scuttled away from its workpiece, and Vincent edged forward to inspect the plywood. Murdoch stared at his screen, heart pounding in anticipation.

On the workbench, was a precise 50mm diameter circle, smoke still rising from the laser-engraved smiley face. As Vincent picked up the pieces, Murdoch noticed that - although the two pieces came apart without resistance - there was no circular marking on the workbench where the router had cut through. The robot had guided the cut perfectly.

"Holy moly," said Vincent.

Murdoch agreed. It was impressive work.

Vincent brought his phone up to his mouth. "Make it fabricate a remote control toy car."

Within two minutes, a maniacally laughing Vincent, newly fabricated remote control in his hands, was driving a miniature cobbled-together car around his garage.

Murdoch leaned back in his chair and smiled. Vincent reminded him of himself - back in his youth, on his home planet, before his exile to Elba. God, how he missed those days. He knew he'd never get them back. A hundred thousand years was a long time - even if he made it home, the place would be unrecognizable. Still, he'd love to see it again.

In the meantime, it was time to celebrate. He rewarded himself with a cigarette. His ape had done it - fully automated manufacturing. It should all be smooth sailing from here.
