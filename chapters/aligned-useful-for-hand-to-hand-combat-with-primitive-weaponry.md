## 0. Aligned, Useful for Hand-to-Hand Combat With Primitive Weaponry

"Allen's crushing us," Gabe announced.

Steve looked at the scoreboard. Oh boy. "How did that happen?"

"He's got a new technique. He's ditching the ancestral meme format."

Interesting. The ancestral meme format was their top performer so far. The idea was to piggyback off the apes' existing familial bonds - Steve and Gabe took turns pretending to be players' dead ancestors while speaking into their heads. They'd saved a few thousand souls this way, but the memes always struggled to find purchase outside of their tribes. No one cared about someone else's ancestors.

"What's he doing?" Steve asked.

"Oracles."

"Eh?"

Gabe put down his coffee mug so he could use both hands to gesticulate. "He's made up this whole cast of Gods. They live on a mountain. And he's picked some players and called them 'oracles'".

"Are the Gods the oracles' ancestors?"

"No."

Steve was confused. "So why do they care?"

"He tells them the future. Who's going to win a battle, who's going to mysteriously die, that sort of thing."

"How does he know the future?"

"He intervenes to makes it happen."

Steve opened and closed his mouth. "We're allowed to intervene?" he asked.

Gabe shrugged. "Murdoch isn't stopping him."

Goddamn it. Why hadn't he thought of this?

"How does that lead to alignment?" he asked.

"The AIs are really into it. The oracles credit the Gods with their 'visions' and the AIs go crazy for it. They worship the hell out of these Gods. They go to war for them pretty much constantly. And everyone they conquer also adopts the meme."

"What's he categorizing them as?" Steve asked.

"PrimWep."

Steve laughed. 'PrimWep' was short for 'aligned, useful for hand-to-hand combat with primitive weaponry.' PrimWep was so unlikely to be useful in an interstellar war that he was surprised Murdoch allowed it. All of his saved souls were also categorized as PrimWep.

"Shall we give it a try?" he asked.

Gabe shrugged. "Can't hurt."

Murdoch watched the numbers on his screen go up. Feckin' PrimWeps. He was allowing it for now to keep the competitors excited, but struggled to see how anyone could possibly find these spear-chuckers 'useful.'

Plus, he had bigger immediate problems - everyone had started intervening. Battles were decided, monsters were created, seas were split and food was conjured into existence. Sure, this was causing the AIs to align themselves with whatever 'God' was messing around in their territory this week, but what would happen next week when a different God showed up? What would happen when the AIs were ascended up here and blasted off into space with no intervention in sight? Would they still be loyal then?

Probably not. He should do something. Maybe there was a market solution.

After one of the contestents wiped a competitor's tribe off the map by raining fire and brimstone down from the sky, Murdoch finally called a meeting.

"That's enough!" he said. "I'm introducing a credit system. The more computationally expensive your intervention, the more it costs."

Everyone groaned. Murdoch glared at them all and continued.

"You each get a hundred credits for every useful aligned AI you save. Credits are fungible and transferable. You each get one million credits to start, and if you run out, you're done. Go."

The contestents seemed shocked. And no wonder - the new rule transformed the game. For the first time, it was possible for people to lose.

"Oh yeah," Murdoch added. "One more thing. 'Aligned, useful for hand-to-hand combat with primitive weaponry' is no longer a valid category. Raise your standards, gentlemen."

A few weeks later, Steve and Gabe took stock of their position. It was grim. They'd saved such a meager number of aligned AIs that they all fit onto a tiny fraction of a flash drive. Most of them were classified in sketchy variations of PrimWep. This put them in last place.

Their active memes were largely concentrated in the Northern / Western hemisphere, and consisted mainly of polytheistic canons that glorified dying in battle. They also had one ancestral/monotheistic hybrid meme in the Middle East, whose ostensible adherents struggled both with alignment and military success. It was only their unusually high fecundity that had enabled them to cling on through generation after generation of enslavement and conquest at the hands of more advanced civilizations.

"You ready to throw in the towel?" asked Gabe. "Go back to the university?"

Steve sighed. "It does seem a bit pointless, doesn't it? We're not cut out for this 'warfaring meme' business."

"What are we cut out for?" asked Gabe.

Steve pondered. Truth be told, Gabe wasn't cut out for much outside of his narrow academic interests. He, on the other hand -

"Programming" he replied.

Gabe nodded. "You can program circles round these guys," he agreed. "But what good does that do? We need intervention credits to do anything." He gestured towards the leaderboard, which prominently displayed the number of intervention credits assigned to each team. Their remaining allotment was pitiful.

"It needs to be cheap," Steve said. "Something that mostly piggybacks off the existing StevieNix code so we spend as few credits as possible. What are we trying to achieve?"

Gabe looked at their scattered map of players. Dozens of tribes, all running mutually incompatible memes, mostly dominated by one massive militarized empire in Allen's camp. Allen's yield was two orders of magnitude greater than theirs.

"We need to unify our players," Gabe said. "Get them all on the same meme. We'll never get anywhere if they're constantly fighting each other."

Steve looked at his mass of failed experiments and sighed.

"Ideally," Gabe continued, "the meme would even eat away at Allen's camp. See if we can get them to defect."

"You've finally gotten into this, haven't you?"

Gabe shrugged. "Might as well go down swinging."

Steve racked his brain, running through the requirements. A cheap intervention that was impressive enough to infect a hostile military empire. Ideally, he could find some way to piggyback off existing StevieNix features to keep the costs down.

He thought back to the early days, when StevieNix was just a hobby running in the CS department break room. How he enjoyed walking around in VR, talking to the apes and avoiding the reptiles.

"I know what we'll do," he said. "We'll send me."
