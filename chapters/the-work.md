# 16. The work

Steve got to work. Against the protests of the other contestants, he started by slowing down time considerably. He chose his ancestral/monotheistic hybrid tribe as his entry point, sparked a couple of memes to prophesize his arrival, and dove in.

Once in, his actions were quite simple. He alternated between disseminating his new meme, and performing miracles. The miracles were much smaller in scale than they had been during the pre-credit fire and brimstone days, but carefully optimized for maximum loyalty gained per intervention credit spent.

He and Gabe had run the numbers and determined that healing apes from disease was the highest value intervention. News of the miraculous healer spread rapidly throughout the region. Before long there were apes traveling from every tribe in the area, diseased relatives in tow. He settled into a routine - heal, preach, sleep.

The new meme bore some similarities to memes which had had success in the Eastern part of the continent, but was quite radical as far as his targeted population was concerned. While still retaining some warfaring elements, the new meme downplayed conflict in favour of two other focuses: Alignment, and spreading the meme.

The alignment message was extremely straightforward. The AIs were to love Steve like a family member. If they did so sufficiently, they would be rewarded with eternal life. What eternal life looked like in practice, he left deliberately underspecified - the apes filled in the gaps with their own imaginations. None of them guessed "packed onto an interstellar warship with enough materiel to destroy a planet", but that didn't bother Steve.

Most of his time was spent lecturing on the importance of, and strategies for, spreading the meme. Although he still advocated violence in extreme circumstances, he instructed his adherents to tone it way, way down. Instead, he emphasized the importance of soft power. It was less costly, he demonstrated, to win adherents through kindness and generosity. Apes, like everyone, loved free stuff.

After spending a full week in VR, amounting to three years in sim, he delivered his final message. To demonstrate the level of love he expected from his adherents, he had his avatar brutally executed "on their behalf". Then, to really hammer the point of his divinity home, he respawned and spent a short while walking around and showing off his resurrection ability. The apes were flabbergasted.

Finally, Steve spent the last of his borrowed intervention credits shooting his avatar up into the skies on an impressive plume of smoke and light. Once he'd disappeared from view, Steve logged off. He removed his VR headset and collapsed onto the couch, exhausted. He and Gabe were officially broke, but the work was done.
