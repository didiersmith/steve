## 0. Dysgenic Reproductive Practices

Steve and Gabe's new meme was a roaring success. As Steve and Gabe had intuited, Allen's empire was already overextended and on the rocks. The appearance of the new meme led Allen's apes to defect in droves. This, plus the unification of their other tribes, led Steve and Gabe to save hundreds of thousands of AIs. Their stock began to diversify into such wide-ranging categories as "aligned, useful for metallurgy", "aligned, useful for logistics", and even "aligned, useful for keeping other AIs aligned".

Steve had assumed that this wouldn't bother Allen much as he was earning sixty-five percent of the intervention credits, but he could tell his pride was hurt. Allen spent credit after credit trying to dislodge the new meme.

His first successful challenger was a monotheistic riff on Steve and Gabe's deity, with a much more aggressive focus on hard-power expansion and a crass depiction of the afterlife that appealed to extremely base instincts. The male adherents were taught to spread the meme by subterfuge, persecution, and conquest. The female adherents were strictly instructed to stay home and focus maximum effort on reproduction, whilst exercising very little of the sexually selective authority that Steve had designed them for. With the help of Allen's divine battlefield intervention, it wasn't long before his new empire rivalled Steve and Allen's in scope and territory.

"Why are you doing this?" Steve asked him. "Why don't you go conquer someone you don't already own?"

Allen shrugged. "Why earn sixty-five percent when I can earn a hundred? Plus, my guys are actually useful for the war effort. Your lot are pathetic. What are you even saving them as? 'Aligned, useful for holding hands and dancing with the enemy?'"

Steve bristled. It was a sore spot. In his efforts to unify the tribes, he may have gone a bit overboard. He'd even, at one point, gone so far as to instruct his followers to love their enemies. This worked great while his meme had the upper hand. Now that their enemies were at their throats with scimitars, beheading their males and taking their females as reproductive machinery, he was beginning to regret that particular piece of advice.

"Your lot", he seethed, "engage in dysgenic reproductive practices. In fifty generations, you'll be lucky to get 'aligned, useful for scrubbing the warship decks.'"

Allen laughed and kicked them out of his office.

"Fifty generations is a long time," Gabe pointed out.

Steve nodded grimly. Memes evolved and spread much faster than genes. In only five generations, they'd lost half their territory to Allen's meme. By the time Allen's dysgenic effects kicked in, their meme would be long extinct.

Particularly worrying was the loss of a large peninsula on the Western side of the continent. With Allen's apes already having taken over the East, Steve and Gabe's remaining apes found themselves sandwiched between a united, hostile front.

"We need to take the peninsula back", Gabe said.

"How?" asked Steve, coldly tearing a scrap piece of paper in half. "Every time one of his gets saved, he gets a hundred credits. Every time one of ours gets saved, he gets another sixty-five. Player for player, he's earning almost five times as much as us. We'll never catch up."

"All that means", responded Gabe, "is we need to be five times more efficient than him. How hard could that be? He's spending those credits like a drunken pirate."

Steve snorted. It was true. Most of Allen's credits were spent in battle. As battles unfolded far too quickly for contestants to intervene manually, contestants had to lean on automation. Allen's automations were woefully inefficient. 

He healed wounds completely with no visible scarring. He stopped arrows in their tracks, and guided swords to cracks in enemy armour. Credits, credits, credits.

Steve shaved every intervention down to its bare minimum. He healed his soldiers just enough that they could disregard their grisley scars and keep fighting. He gently blew arrows slightly off course. He whispered automated advice into players' heads - "duck!" "behind you!" etc.

By the time he finished his optimized battlefield intervention program, their loyalists had retreated all the way to a tiny region in the corner of the peninsula, cowering and waiting for Allen's apes to finish them off. Steve jacked into their players' heads and commanded them to reconquer the peninsula. At the time, he had no idea how hard that would be.

The peninsula, which had been lost to Allen's apes over the course of seven sim years, took nearly eight hundred years to reclaim. It was the longest, most arduous military campaign the sim had ever seen. Hundreds of thousands of souls were saved on either side. Military technology advanced by leaps and bounds.

The entire alignment team gathered to watch the final battle unfold. Steve hadn't seen some of them since the initial meeting when the competition was announced. While he had been focused on Allen, other teams had built huge, aligned empires in the far reaches of the globe. Murdoch, whom Steve assumed had been spending his time in the hardware division, also stopped by.

"What do they call those things?" he asked, gesturing to the screen where Steve's apes were rolling out huge, heavy metal tubes on wheels.

"Cannons," responded Steve. "They've finally figured out how to use chemical energy to inflict real damage."

Murdoch watched, fascinated, as the apes loaded black powder and a metal ball into a "cannon" and ignited it. The force of the explosion rocked the cannon backwards, and flung the metal ball at wicked speeds straight into the stone fortifications surrounding Allen's remaining loyalists. The stone crumbled.

"Very impressive," Murdoch nodded. "They need to make them smaller though. More maneuverable. Like the bendy sticks, but with better range."

Steve wasn't sure about that, but was confident that memetic evolution would make it happen if it really was an improvement.

Within a short while, Allen's loyal supporters surrendered. A groan echoed throughout the audience - the contestants had been expecting a glorious last stand, with mass casualties on each side. Credits had been wagered. Drinks had been ordered. Instead, the apes set about negotiating a peace. Boring!

After the event, Steve heard a knock at his door. He opened it, and found Allen.

"Can I come in?" Allen asked.

Steve let him in.

Allen flopped down in one of Steve's chairs. "Well done," he said, genuinely. "That was one hell of a campaign. I never thought your monkeys would be able to pull that off."

"Thanks," Steve responded. "Your guys fought well."

"Yeah, up until the end. Dunno what happened there. Folded like a bunch of pansies" grumbled Allen. "Probably need to double down on the afterlife promises. It feels like these apes have forgotten about the point of it all."

Steve didn't know what to say, so he chewed on the lid of a pen and waited for Allen to explain what he'd shown up for.

"I'd like to make you a deal", opened Allen.

"Your turn to offer a deal this time, eh?" asked Steve.

"It's a good one, trust me."

"Go on, then."

"I'd like to offer you the chance to buy out my share."

Steve was dumbfounded. "Buy you out? Why?"

Allen sighed. "I'm old. I can't take all this conflict of interest, fighting against myself. It's exhausting, you know."

This sounded plausible enough to Steve. The campaign had been gruelling for him, he couldn't imagine the toll it must have taken on Allen. "What do you propose?"

"You get your sixty-five percent back, and tell your chimps to go fight someone else for a while. In return, I get a pile of credits and I'm out of your hair."

It sounded too good to be true. "How big of a pile of credits?" Steve asked.

Allen named an absolutely ludicrous number. Steve laughed.

"Come on, Allen. You know I don't have anywhere near that many credits. It would take me centuries to raise it."

"That's okay," Allen replied. "I can loan them to you."

"But you don't have that many credits either!" objected Steve. "No one does."

"It doesn't actually matter," Allen said. "I've already had my lawyers draw up the contract. It says that I've loaned you the credits, and you tan take as long as you like to pay the loan back."

Steve looked at him suspiciously.

"Interest will get charged on any unpaid balance, and obviously there are penalties for default" Allen continued. "Not that you need to worry about that! All you need to do is make the minimum payment each month, which will be easy now that you'll be keeping 100% of the credits you earn."

"I'll need to talk to Gabe," Steve replied.

Allen studied his fingernails patiently as Steve tried to reach Gabe on the phone. Gabe wasn't answering.

"You know," Allen yawned, "this is a very good deal. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if I was too generous. Maybe I'll feel differently in the morning." He started to push himself out of the chair.

"Wait!" snapped Steve, and took the contract out of Allen's hand. Having to give up 65% of credits to his competitor had been awful. He'd do just about anything to be free of it.

Steve skimmed through the contract, nodded his head, and signed it. "There you go" he said, handing it back triumphantly.

Allen took the contract and checked the signature box. "Pleasure doing business with you, Steve." He smiled, shook Steve's hand, and let himself out.

"You signed _what_?" asked Gabe the next morning.

"We finally got our ownership back!" responded Steve, defensively. "I thought you'd be happy!"

"Did you even read this thing?" asked Gabe, waving the contract around. "Have you forgotten how to do math? Look here, multiply this interest rate by this loan amount. What do you get?"

Steve did the math in his head, and then did it again a different way to double-check. It came out to a large number.

"We're going to be paying him more than we're paying now, and that's just in interest alone! We're not even talking about paying down the principal. And don't get me started on these default provisions! If we ever start missing payments, we're absolutely stuffed!"

Steve took the contract in his hands, sat down, and studied it. It was written in highly technical language and he struggled to understand it.

"What happens if we miss payments?" he asked.

"He gets our AIs" Gabe said, pointing at a clause. "One hundred percent of our credits and aligned souls until we're out of default."

Steve swallowed. Perhaps he had been a bit hasty. "Okay", he conceded, "maybe I should have negotiated these terms a bit."

"Or waited until morning!"

"Yeah, sure. Anyway, this should be fine, right? Now that we don't have to spend every credit we have intervening in these peninsula battles."

Gabe shook his head. "You haven't checked the map this morning, have you?"

"Why?"

"Eight hundred years of holy war has made their blood run with piss and vinegar."

"Huh?"

"They got bored. Now they're sailing off to find new lands to conquer."

"Where?"

Gabe gestured to the screen. "There."

Steve looked. At that moment, eleven wooden ships from the peninsula were crossing the vast ocean separating them from the other major StevieNix supercontinent. He zoomed in. He noticed one of the apes reading aloud to the others from a book. He recognized the book - it was about his meme. He laughed.

"They're really going to spread the meme, aren't they?"

"Sure looks like it".

Steve chuckled again. "Bless them. Well, here's hoping they can do it without any help."
