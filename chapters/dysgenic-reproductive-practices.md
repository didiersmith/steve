## 0. Dysgenic Reproductive Practices

Finally, some success! It felt good to be climbing the leaderboard. As Steve had guessed, Allen's empire was already overextended and on the rocks. Steve's meme had caused them to defect in droves. After a few sim centuries, his and Gabe's total aligned soul count began to rival Allen's.

For the first time, they had a real shot at winning the competition. That was, until Allen riffed on his meme.

"This is bad," Gabe said, watching their apes lose yet another battle. "Didn't you eradicate sexual violence?"

Steve leaned in for a closer look, and raised his eyebrows.

"Only in most cases," he said. "It doesn't work if they kill off all their male relatives."

"Ah," said Gabe. "Yes, they're doing that."

Shit. Steve sat down and watched for a while. Allen's adherents had adopted an extremely brutal sexually dimorphic strategy. The males dedicated their lives to spreading the meme by all means necessary - including subterfuge, persecution, and conquest. The females focused maximum effort on reproduction whilst exercising very little of the sexually selective authority that he'd designed them for.

The meme was perfect. Except -

"This is dysgenic," he concluded. "They're going to select for brutes again."

Gabe in tow, he marched down the hallway to talk some sense into Allen.

---

"Why are you doing this?" Steve demanded. "Why don't you go conquer someone you don't already own?"

Allen shrugged. "Why earn sixty-five percent when I can earn a hundred? Plus, my guys are actually useful for the war effort. Your lot are pathetic. What are you even saving them as? 'Aligned, useful for loving the enemy to death?'"

Steve bristled. It was a sore spot. In his efforts to unify his tribes, he'd enthusiastically instructed his followers to love their enemies. This worked great for converting demoralized, dejected enemies who were looking for a new meme anyway.

But now, the enemies were anything but demoralized. Instead, they were beheading his males and taking his females as reproductive machinery. Different situation, calls for a different strategy. Too bad he couldn't afford to go down and tell them.

"Your lot," he seethed, "engage in dysgenic reproductive practices. In fifty generations, you'll be lucky to get 'aligned, useful for scrubbing the warship decks.'"

Allen laughed and kicked them out of his office.

---

"Fifty generations is a long time," Gabe pointed out.

Steve nodded grimly. Memes evolved and spread much faster than genes. In only five generations, they'd lost half their territory to Allen's meme. By the time Allen's dysgenic effects kicked in, their meme would be long extinct.

Particularly worrying was the loss of a large peninsula on the Western side of the continent. With Allen's apes already having taken over the East, Steve and Gabe's remaining apes found themselves sandwiched between a united, hostile front.

"We need to take the peninsula back," Gabe said.

"How?" asked Steve, coldly tearing a scrap piece of paper in half. "Every time one of his gets saved, he gets a hundred credits. Every time one of ours gets saved, he gets another sixty-five. Player for player, he's earning almost five times as much as us. We'll never catch up."

"All that means," responded Gabe, "is we need to be five times more efficient than him. How hard could that be? He's spending those credits like a drunken pirate."

Steve snorted. It was true. Most of Allen's credits were spent in battle. As battles unfolded far too quickly for contestants to intervene manually, contestants had to lean on automation. Allen's automations were woefully inefficient.

He healed wounds completely with no visible scarring. He stopped arrows in their tracks, and guided swords to cracks in enemy armour. Credits, credits, credits.

Steve got to work. He shaved every intervention down to its bare minimum. He healed his soldiers just enough that they could disregard their grisly scars and keep fighting. He gently blew arrows slightly off course. He whispered automated advice into players' heads - "duck!" "behind you!" etc.

By the time he finished his optimized battlefield intervention program, their loyalists had retreated all the way to a tiny region in the corner of the peninsula, cowering and waiting for Allen's apes to finish them off. Steve jacked into their players' heads and commanded them to reconquer the peninsula. How hard could that possibly be?

It turned out to be very hard indeed.

The peninsula, which had been lost to Allen's apes over the course of seven sim years, took nearly eight hundred years to reclaim. It was the longest, most arduous military campaign the sim had ever seen. Hundreds of thousands of souls were saved on either side. Military technology advanced by leaps and bounds.

The entire alignment team gathered to watch the final battle unfold. Steve hadn't seen some of them since the initial meeting when the competition was announced. While he had been focused on Allen, other teams had built huge, aligned empires in the far reaches of the globe. Even Murdoch came to watch.

"What do they call those things?" he asked, gesturing to the screen where Steve's apes were rolling out huge, heavy metal tubes on wheels.

"Cannons," responded Steve. "They've finally figured out how to use chemical energy to inflict real damage."

Murdoch watched with a fascinated expression, as the apes loaded black powder and a metal ball into a "cannon" and ignited it. The force of the explosion rocked the cannon backwards, and flung the metal ball at wicked speeds straight into the stone fortifications surrounding Allen's remaining loyalists. The stone crumbled and a huge gap opened up in the wall.

"Cannons, eh?" Murdoch asked. "The rock throwers' revenge. Very impressive."

Within a short while, Allen's loyal supporters surrendered. A groan echoed throughout the audience - the contestants had been expecting a glorious last stand, with mass casualties on each side. Credits had been wagered. Drinks had been ordered. Instead, the apes set about negotiating a peace. Boring!

After the event, Steve heard a knock at his door. He opened it, and found Allen.

"Can I come in?" Allen asked, striding through the door without waiting for an answer. He flopped down in one of Steve's chairs. "Well done," he said. "That was one hell of a campaign. I never thought your monkeys would be able to pull that off."

"Thanks," Steve replied, making his way back to his desk. "Your guys fought well."

"Yeah, up until the end," grumbled Allen. "Then they folded like a bunch of pansies. What was that about? Did they forget about the afterlife?"

Steve didn't know what to say, so he chewed on the lid of a pen and waited for Allen to explain why he'd shown up.

"Anyway," said Allen. "I'd like to make you a deal."

A deal from Allen! That was a new one. "What is it?" Steve asked.

"It's a good one, trust me."

"Go on, then."

"How would you like to buy out my share in your meme?"

Steve's throat dried up. He would like that very much. "Why?"

Allen sighed. "I'm old. I can't take all this conflict of interest, fighting against myself. It's exhausting, you know."

Sounded plausible enough. The campaign had been gruelling enough for Steve, and he had won! How bad must it have been for Allen? "What do you propose?" he asked.

"You get your sixty-five percent back, and tell your chimps to go fight someone else for a while. In return, I get a pile of credits and I'm out of your hair."

It sounded too good to be true. "How big of a pile of credits?" Steve asked.

Allen named an absolutely ludicrous number. Steve laughed.

"Come on, Allen. You know I don't have anywhere near that many credits. It would take me centuries to raise it."

"That's okay," Allen replied. "I can loan them to you."

"But you don't have that many credits either!" objected Steve. "No one does."

"It doesn't actually matter," Allen said. "You don't actually need credits to write loans - all you need is a lawyer. I've already had mine draw up the contract."

He pulled a stack of paper out of his briefcase and slid it across Steve's desk. "It says that I've loaned you the credits, and you tan take as long as you like to pay the loan back."

Steve looked at the paper suspiciously.

"Interest will get charged on any unpaid balance," Allen continued. "And obviously there are penalties for default - not that you need to worry about that! All you need to do is make the minimum payment each month, which will be easy!"

Minimum payments. Sounded managable. Still - "I'll need to talk to Gabe," Steve said.

Steve tried to reach Gabe on the phone. He wasn't answering.

"You know," Allen yawned, studying his fingernails. "This is a very good deal. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if I was too generous. Maybe I'll feel differently in the morning." He started to push himself out of the chair and reached across the desk for the contract.

"Wait!" snapped Steve, and snatched the contract out of Allen's reach. Having to give up 65% of credits to his competitor had been awful. He'd do just about anything to be free of it.

Steve skimmed through the contract, nodded his head, and signed it. "There you go," he said, pushing it back across the desk.

Allen took the contract and checked the signature box. "Pleasure doing business with you, Steve." He smiled, shook Steve's hand, and let himself out.

---

"You signed _what_?" asked Gabe the next morning.

"We finally got our ownership back! I thought you'd be happy!"

"Did you even read this thing? Have you forgotten how to do math? Look here, multiply this interest rate by this loan amount. What do you get?"

Steve did the math in his head, and then did it again a different way to double-check. It came out to a large number.

"We're going to be paying him more than we're paying now, and that's just in interest alone! We're not even talking about paying down the principal. And don't get me started on these default provisions! If we ever start missing payments, we're absolutely stuffed!"

Steve took the contract in his hands, sat down, and studied it. It was written in highly technical language. What the hell was a default provision?

"What happens if we miss payments?" he asked.

"He gets our AIs," Gabe said, pointing at a clause. "One hundred percent of our credits and aligned souls until we're out of default."

Steve swallowed. Perhaps he had been a bit hasty. "Okay," he conceded, "maybe I should have negotiated these terms a bit."

"Or waited until morning!"

"Yeah, sure. Anyway, this should be fine, right? Now that we don't have to spend every credit we have intervening in these peninsula battles."

Gabe shook his head. "You haven't checked the map this morning, have you?"

"Why?"

"Eight hundred years of holy war has made their blood run with piss and vinegar."

"Huh?"

"The monkeys got bored. Now they're sailing off to find new lands to conquer."

"Where?"

Gabe gestured to the screen. "There."

Steve looked. At that moment, eleven wooden ships from the peninsula were crossing the vast ocean separating them from the other major StevieNix supercontinent. He zoomed in. He noticed one of the apes reading aloud to the others from a book. He recognized the book - it was about his meme. He laughed.

"They're really going to spread the meme, aren't they?"

"Sure looks like it".

Steve chuckled again. "Bless them. Well, here's hoping they can do it without any help."
