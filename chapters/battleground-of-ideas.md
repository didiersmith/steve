# 12. Battleground of ideas

Steve looked around the table. Aside from Gabe and Murdoch, there was one other face he recognized - Maurice Allen, founder and CEO of Eternal Spring. Like Murdoch, Allen's life stretched back to before the Great Peace, when Eternal Spring had been one of a dozen life extension startups. Unlike Murdoch, Allen's company had not been birthed into a privileged monopolistic position - Eternal Spring's rise to dominance was bathed in rumours of espionage, anticompetitive practices, and assassination. All that was ancient history though - for as long as Steve had lived, Eternal Spring had been the company responsible for keeping him and everyone else young and immortal.

"Get the Spring back in your step! Ask your doctor about Eternal Spring."

Murdoch went round the room and introduced the team. Aside from Steve, Gabe and Allen, the team was entirely composed of Murdoch's acquaintances - either through his personal life, or through their employment at Murdoch Heavy Industries. After completing the introductions, Murdoch started presenting a slide deck.

"As you are all no doubt aware", he started, "we are faced with an existential threat. Two existential threats, in fact. The first being, obviously, the discovery of a technologically advanced alien race stomping around in our corner of the galaxy, who have a real possibility of accidentally blundering us out of existence within a few short centuries."

"The second", he continued, "is even more serious. While you all understand perfectly well the reality of the first threat, the mass of gormless buffoons making up our society do not, will not, and most likely can not. As in, they lack even the basic mental hardware to comprehend the threat. Plans are already underway to build an orbital interstellar radio so we can phone the aliens up, presumably to broadcast something along the lines of 'Hey aliens! Primitive intelligent life here! Come enslave us and take our carbon!'"

Steve looked around the room. Everyone was nodding in agreement. The occupants had clearly been very carefully selected.

"Naturally", Murdoch chuckled, "MHI will be offering the government some very competitive bids on the project. Tricky things, interstellar radios. You never know what might go wrong."

Everyone other than Steve and Gabe laughed, and Steve realized they'd been even more carefully selected than he'd thought. Thinly veiled jokes about sabotaging unfathomably expensive government projects weren't usually well received in the company he was used to keeping.

"But stall as we might, we must treat it as inevitable that our respective species will one day interact. In the absence of anyone else with the cojones to do what must be done, I have taken it upon myself to see that this interaction doesn't result in our immediate extinction."

The occupants nodded along.

"Hardware is being taken care of by downstairs as we speak. It presents major challenges, but an even greater challenge still is intelligence. To ensure our survival, we must develop the mental capacity to wage total, all-consuming war, at distances so vast that any communication with the front would take years or even centuries. The agents conducting this warfare must be capable of autonomously performing a ruthless alien genocide, all whilst not presenting us with a third existential risk. It should go without saying that we would be extremely hard-pressed to develop this capacity within our own species, and even if we did, harder still to do it under the radar while producing the trillions of soldiers necessary."

Steve gulped. Trillions? Murdoch had not previously mentioned trillions.

"And to that end, MHI has employed Steve, the genius creator of StevieNix himself! Why don't you give us a status report, Steve?"

All eyes swiveled towards Steve. He was unprepared. "Well", he stammered, "we have a bloodthirsty race of violent warriors".

Over the next few minutes, he explained the basic StevieNix environment, the sexual reproduction mechanic, and the tight family bonds that resulted. He then went over his past several months' work - the sentience, the evolutionarily stable aggression, and finally the notion of playability and the playable/non-playable character split.

"Of course", he concluded awkwardly, "this was all before I heard we had to make trillions of them. I'm not sure the sim planet has the capacity for that."

"Pardon my ignorance", interrupted Allen, "but why can't we just make one of them and copy/paste it a trillion times?"

"It's a zero-copy architecture" responded Steve simply.

Allen looked at him blankly.

Steve attempted to clarify. "We had to move to using particle computers to get the parallelism required" he offered. "Particle computers are subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and thus the no-copy theorem."

Steve looked around the room. Most of the other occupants were mirroring Allen's blank stare.

"If we copy them, it messes them up. All we can do is run them, freeze them, and move them" he tried.

That explanation seemed to satisfy the crowd.

"OK, no copies. Guess you get to figure out how to make a trillion of them, then" responded Allen. "Good luck. Anyway, what's your plan for making sure they don't kill us all?"

Steve drew a blank. He knew that playability had something to do with it, but had mostly been hoping that the other occupants of the room had solved this problem. Fortunately, Murdoch stepped in to rescue him from the interrogation.

"Memes" he responded. Everyone swiveled back towards him.

"Memes are self-propagating ideas", he explained. "They spread throughout populations like viruses - replicating, mutating, responding to selective pressure. This stupid orbital telescope is a meme. Astrology is a meme. The Great Peace, the government, money, it's all memes."

"The collection of memes that make up our collective consciousness", he continued, "will never be dislodged. It's perfect. People are so scared of going back to the before times that they'd sooner commit mass suicide than change their way of thinking. What's even stupider", he vented, "is that the memes aren't even true."

He glanced towards Allen, who nodded knowingly.

"But the truth is irrelevant. Evolution doesn't care. The battleground of ideas selects for ideas that are powerful, not true."

Steve wondered what he meant by that, but Murdoch continued without elaboration.

"We have no hope up here. Our mythology won't budge until the aliens are stamping on our necks. But in StevieNix, it's different. Down there, we can read their thoughts, and speak into their minds. We can also run their universe a million times faster than here, and kill vast numbers of them at will. Down there, we actually have a real shot."

"So what do you propose?" asked Allen.

Murdoch smiled. "A friendly competition", he responded. He advanced the slide deck. "You'll be split into teams of two", he proposed. "Each team's task is to breed as many playable, useful aligned AIs as possible. A useful AI is any AI that would serve a serve a function in an interstellar war. Intelligence and aggression are table stakes. An aligned AI is one that loves us like one of their little monkey family members - they'd kill and die for us, but would never hurt us. Your primary tool is memes. Speak them into the playable characters' heads and see what happens. First team to a trillion wins."

Steve assumed that the prize had been left deliberately unspecified.

Allen seemed unconvinced. "How do we know they're aligned?" he asked.

"We can read their thoughts, remember?" responded Murdoch.

Allen followed up. "We can't read the NPCs' minds. What are they for?"

Murdoch smiled. "We need to see how good the players are at killing, don't we?"
