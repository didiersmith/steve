## 0. Battleground of Ideas

Steve looked around the table. Aside from Gabe and Murdoch, there was one other face he recognized - Maurice Allen, founder and CEO of Eternal Spring. Like Murdoch, Allen's life stretched back to before the Great Peace, when Eternal Spring had been one of a dozen life extension startups. Unlike Murdoch, Allen's company had not been birthed into a privileged monopolistic position - Eternal Spring's rise to dominance was bathed in rumours of espionage, anticompetitive practices, and assassination. All that was ancient history though - for as long as Steve had lived, Eternal Spring had been the company responsible for keeping him and everyone else young and immortal.

_"Keep the Spring in your step! Ask your doctor about Eternal Spring."_

Murdoch went round the room and introduced the team. Aside from Steve, Gabe and Allen, the team was entirely composed of Murdoch's acquaintances - either through his personal life, or through their employment at Murdoch Heavy Industries. After completing the introductions, Murdoch started presenting a slide deck.

"As you are all no doubt aware", he started, "we are faced with an existential threat. Two existential threats, in fact. The first being, obviously, the discovery of a technologically advanced alien race stomping around in our corner of the galaxy, who have a real possibility of accidentally blundering us out of existence."

"The second", he continued, "is even more serious. While you all understand perfectly well the reality of the first threat, the mass of gormless buffoons making up our society do not, will not, and most likely can not - as in, they lack even the basic mental hardware to comprehend the threat. Plans are already underway to build an orbital interstellar radio so we can phone the aliens up, presumably to broadcast something along the lines of 'Hey aliens! Primitive intelligent life here! Come enslave us and take our carbon!'"

Steve looked around the room. Everyone was nodding in agreement. The occupants had clearly been very carefully selected.

"Naturally," Murdoch chuckled, "MHI will be offering the government some very competitive bids on the project. Tricky things, interstellar radios. You never know what might go wrong."

Everyone other than Steve and Gabe laughed, and Steve realized they'd been even more carefully selected than he'd thought. Thinly veiled jokes about sabotaging government projects weren't usually well received in the company he was used to keeping.

"But stall as we might, we must treat it as inevitable that our respective species will one day interact. In the absence of anyone else with the guts to do what must be done, I have taken it upon myself to see that this interaction doesn't result in our immediate extinction."

The occupants nodded along.

"Hardware is being taken care of by downstairs as we speak. It presents major challenges, but an even greater challenge still is intelligence. To ensure our survival, we must develop the mental capacity to wage total, all-consuming war at vast distances. The agents conducting this warfare must be capable of autonomously performing a ruthless alien genocide, all whilst not presenting us with a third existential risk. It should go without saying that we would be extremely hard-pressed to develop this capacity within our own species, and even if we did, harder still to do it under the radar."

"And to that end," he concluded, "MHI has employed Steve - the genius creator of StevieNix himself! Why don't you give us a status report, Steve?"

All eyes swivelled towards Steve. He was unprepared. "Well," he stammered, "we have a bloodthirsty race of violent warrior AIs".

Over the next few minutes, he explained the basic StevieNix environment, the sexual reproduction mechanic, and the tight family bonds that resulted. He then went over his past several months' work - the sentience, the evolutionarily stable aggression, and finally the playable/non-playable character split.

"Great work, Steve" responded Allen. 

Steve bowed his head a little. The first person other than Murdoch to compliment his work, and it was another hundred-thousand-year-old billionaire.

"So what's your plan for making sure they don't kill us all?" Allen asked.

Steve drew a blank. He knew that playability had something to do with it, but had mostly been hoping that the other occupants of the room had solved this problem. Fortunately, Murdoch stepped in to rescue him from the interrogation.

"We align them" he said, "with memes." Everyone swivelled back towards him.

"Memes are self-propagating ideas", he explained. "They spread throughout populations like viruses - replicating, mutating, responding to selective pressure. This stupid orbital telescope is a meme. The Great Peace, the government, breakfast sandwiches, it's all memes. The great thing about memes is they don't even need to be true! Breakfast sandwiches are awful. And the Great Peace...don't get me started."

Steve wondered what he meant by that.

"Not quite following," Allen said. "What do breakfast sandwiches have to do with containing your murderous AIs?"

Murdoch smiled and advanced the slide deck. The title said "A Friendly Competition."

"Everyone in this room is welcome to participate" he announced. "The goal is to save as many playable, aligned AIs as possible. An aligned AI is one that loves us like one of their little monkey family members - they'd kill and die for us, but would never hurt us. And they have to be useful! No flower-pickers" he said with a pointed look at Steve.

"Your primary tool is memes. Speak them into the playable characters' minds and see if you can get them to love you. First team to a trillion souls wins."

Steve raised his hand. "What happens to the AIs that aren't aligned?"

"I'll take them," Murdoch replied. "I have a use for them."

Skipping over what possible use Murdoch may have for millions of murderous AIs that hadn't proven their loyalty, the team moved on.

"How do we know they're aligned?" Allen asked.

"We can read their thoughts, remember?" responded Murdoch.

"We can't read the NPCs' minds. What do we do with them?"

Murdoch laughed. "The players need people to kill, don't they?"
