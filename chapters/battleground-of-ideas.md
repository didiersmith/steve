## 0. Battleground of Ideas

Steve looked around the table for anyone he recognized, and - no way! That was Maurice Allen - the Eternal Spring guy!

Eternal Spring was the life extension monopoly whose vitamins kept Steve and everyone else young and immortal. Their signature tagline popped into Steve's head. _"Keep the Spring in your step! Ask your doctor about Eternal Spring."_ Allen, their CEO and founder, had been around forever. Probably as old as Murdoch.

He looked great, though. Must have a hell of a fitness routine.

Murdoch went round the room and introduced everyone. Aside from Steve, Gabe and Allen, the team appeared to be composed entirely of Murdoch's acquaintances - either through his personal life, or through their employment at Murdoch Heavy Industries. After completing the introductions, Murdoch started presenting a slide deck. Steve's eyes immediately glazed over.

"As you are all no doubt aware," Murdoch announced, "we are faced with an existential threat. Two existential threats, in fact. The first being, obviously, the discovery of a technologically advanced alien race with a real chance of stomping us out of existence."

"The second," he continued, "is even more serious. While you all understand perfectly well the reality of the first threat, the mass of gormless buffoons making up our society do not. And good luck convincing them! I'm pretty sure they lack the requisite mental hardware to process threats."

Most of the room laughed.

"Can you believe they even want to call them up? The government's already put out a tender for an interstellar radio. Presumably so we can broadcast something like, 'Hey aliens! Primitive intelligent life here! Come enslave us and take our carbon!'"

Gabe was turning slightly red, but everyone else in the room was chuckling and nodding in agreement. Steve remembered their conversation in the university break room. Was Murdoch making fun of them?

"Naturally," Murdoch continued, "MHI will be offering the government a very competitive bid on the project. Tricky things, interstellar radios. You never know what might go wrong."

Great, now he was joking - hopefully - about sabotaging a government project.

"But stall as we might, we must treat it as inevitable that our respective species will one day interact. In the absence of anyone else with the guts to do what must be done, I have taken it upon myself to see that this interaction doesn't result in our immediate extinction."

The others nodded along.

Murdoch's tone became more serious. "Hardware is being taken care of downstairs as we speak. It presents major challenges, but an even greater challenge still is intelligence. To ensure our survival, we must develop the mental capacity to wage total, all-consuming war - at interstellar distances."

He clicked to advance the slide deck.

"The agents conducting this warfare must be capable of autonomously performing a ruthless alien genocide, all whilst not presenting us with a third existential risk. It should go without saying that we would be extremely hard-pressed to develop this capacity within our own species, and even if we did, harder still to do it under the radar."

Steve's pulse quickened and he could feel his face getting hot. The design brief had been warriors. Interstellar war, that was the goal. This was the first he'd heard of interstellar genocide.

"And to that end," Murdoch concluded, "Murdoch Heavy Industries has employed Steve - the genius creator of StevieNix himself! Why don't you give us a status report, Steve?"

All eyes swivelled towards Steve. Great. What a handoff.

"Well," Steve stammered, looking for ways to describe his progress towards an alien genocide. "I guess we have a bloodthirsty race of violent warrior AIs".

Over the next few minutes, he explained the basic StevieNix environment, the sexual reproduction mechanic, and the tight family bonds that resulted. He then went over his past several months' work - the sentience, the evolutionarily stable aggression, and finally the playable/non-playable character split.

When he was done, the rest of the team mostly stared at him in silence. Awed silence, hopefully.

Allen spoke up. "Great work, Steve. What's your plan for making sure they don't kill us all?"

No idea. Steve looked at Murdoch for help.

Murdoch tapped a key on his laptop and the slide on the wall changed to one with the title, "Memetic Alignment."

"We align them," Murdoch said, "with memes." He advanced the deck again to a diagram that looked like it was put together by a paranoid schizophrenic with grand theories.

"Memes are self-propagating ideas," he explained, pointing at various parts of the diagram. "They spread through populations like viruses - replicating, mutating, responding to selective pressure. Anywhere where ideas can spread and change, you'll find memes. Our world is full of them, and so is StevieNix."

"How does this help?" Allen asked.

"Memes are absurdly powerful," Murdoch said. "Think about it. Memes dictate culture, culture dictates behaviour. How much of people's day-to-day activities are decided, not by themselves, but by self-replicating ideas that have infected them? People will do anything for the right meme."

"So you're going to infect them with the idea that they shouldn't kill us?" Allen asked.

"Almost," Murdoch said. He advanced the slide deck. The title said "A Friendly Competition."

"_You're_ going to infect them with the idea that they shouldn't kill us."

He advanced the deck again to a list of rules.

"You are all invited to participate!" he said. "The rules are pretty simple. Come up with the sort of memes that would make the AIs love us - so they'll kill and die for us, but would never hurt us. Save any useful AIs that qualify."

The warrior design brief finally made sense.

"Your primary tool is memes. Speak them into the playable characters' minds and see if you can get them to love you. First team to a trillion souls wins."

One of the contestants raised his hand. "What happens to the AIs that aren't aligned?"

"I'll take them," Murdoch replied. "I have a use for them."

Okay, that was weird.

"What does the winner get?" asked one of the contestants.

"Prestige. And a cash prize."

"How much?"

Murdoch named a number. Holy moly, that was a big number. It would be enough for Steve to purchase his own lab, fill it with computers, and finally bring StevieNix into the big leagues. Maybe even hire some staff.

Steve gave Gabe a look and nodded earnestly. Gabe gave him an unenthusiastic flat expression in return. This meeting had probably been the most illegal thing Gabe had ever participated in.

Whatever. Gabe or no Gabe, Steve was determined to win.
