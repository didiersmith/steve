## 0. Stacy II

The railgun was one of Vincent's most cherished inventions. Not so much the gun itself, but the ammunition.

A conventional bullet must perform well in three very different conditions:

1. During the propulsion stage, the bullet must survive an acceleration by an intense shock wave of heat and pressure. 
2. During the ballistic stage, the bullet must fly precisely through the air while conserving as much kinetic energy as possible.
3. Finally, upon impact, the bullet must first penetrate its target before tumbling and dumping all of its kinetic energy.

Due to the tradeoffs involved, it is impossible to design a conventional bullet that performs optimally in all three stages.

By avoiding the necessity of surviving a gunpowder conflagration in the first stage, Vincent was able to avoid the tradeoffs. This allowed him to design a projectile that flew far straighter and inflicted vastly more damage than a conventional round. Absurdly powerful superconductor-based electromagnets accelerated the projectile down the barrel by pulling, not pushing. The carefully designed magnetic field cradled the delicate, rare-earth-infused projectile as it ripped it down the length of the barrel.

The projectile exited the muzzle at six thousand feet per second - twice as fast as a conventional sniper bullet, and over five times the speed of sound. It was shaped more like a dart than a bullet, and its ever-so-slightly curved tail fins caused it to spin like a top as it sliced through the air.

Upon impact, the single-atom-wide diamond-tipped spearhead met almost no resistance from even the tightest bulletproof vest. The dart continued to penetrate with almost no resistance until a flared section two centimeters along the shaft caused it to rapidly decelerate. As the head decelerated, the still-moving tail section piled into it, pushing forwards on an expansion mechanism and causing the head to open outwards. The overall effect was like opening a cocktail umbrella into the target at Mach 5.

Any impact to a human torso caused massive internal damage, no exit wound, and instant death. Even being shot in a limb was typically fatal, due either to the hydrostatic shock on impact or the massive hemorrhage from the limb being blown off.

Vincent's ammo cases were filled with a hundred kilos of these projectiles.

Steve was in a great mood. Murdoch had overclocked the sim last night and twenty years had elapsed in StevieNix. Looking at the stats this morning, he could only conclude that Stacy and Russell had crushed it. For the first time in weeks, his credit counter was non-zero and rising. Out of default. What a comeback.

Doo-de-dooing a little melody to himself, he logged into his computer and checked his notifications.

Oh boy. Three missed calls from Russell. And one from someone he'd never spoken to before - Stacy's teenaged daughter, Stacy II.

Well, that was unusual. Must be something going on.

"My father who art in heaven," thought Stacy II as she huddled in the corner of the marble bastion, cradling her empty M16 carbine to her chest. "Where the hell are you? Please deliver us from...this shitty situation."

"Relax, princess!" Steve's voice popped into her head. "I was just grabbing a coffee. What's up?"

Stacy II's eyes widened. Truth be told, she'd never really believed her mom when she claimed that God spoke into her head. Now that it was happening, her first impression of him was...pretty much as her mom had described.

"I can hear what you're thinking," Steve politely reminded her. "Anyway, catch me up. What's with the gun?"

A bullet slammed into the rock above her head and showered her with shards of marble and dust. She huddled closer to her mom and their two guests, Russell and his son Filbert. They were all out of ammo as well.

"Don't you know?" she thought. "The palace is under attack. We could die at any moment."

"Great!" Steve replied. "I've been waiting for you guys to start dying. You'd better hurry it up or I'm never going to hit quota."

"Huh?"

"Lighten up, it's a joke."

So far, not the world's most impressive divine creator. "Can you please help?" she asked.

A clacking noise filled her head. What the hell was that? It sounded like a keyboard.

"Help? Yeah, don't worry, help is on its way."

"Angels?"

"Vincent and Xavier."

What kind of a useless God was he?

"I heard that."

"Sorry," she thought.

Steve didn't reply. She heard some more clacking and then the line went silent.

The elevator door dinged and the two Anarchists emerged, lugging enormous crates. 

"Backup's here!" her mom exclaimed, and crawled from her corner in the bastion. Stacy II and the others followed her along the wall, crouching to keep their heads below the parapet. 

When they reached the shelter of the elevator, her mom stood up straight and hugged Vincent. "Thank you so much for coming."

"Of course," Vincent said. "Ever fired one of my railguns?"

"Nope."

"You're gonna love it. How many people do we have?"

"What you see," her mom replied, gesturing towards the rest.

Vincent looked confused. "That's it?" he asked. "You've been holding the palace with four people?"

"Three. Filbert's useless."

Stacy II couldn't stop herself from laughing. She was right.

Vincent wasn't so entertained. "This is a bad situation", he said. "Let's manufacture some drones." He pulled out his phone and frowned. "No bars."

Filbert finally spoke up. "They're jamming Starlink," he said. "They also cut the fiber optics."

Vincent tapped at his useless phone in silence.

"Who's 'they?'" Xavier asked.

"Some sort of 'populist revolt,'" the elder Stacy replied. "It's bullshit, though. It's actually a regime-change attempt by the PR." She glared at Russell and Filbert, who avoided her eyes.

Vincent nodded. "Understood. So what are we doing?"

"We're defending the palace."

Vincent surveyed the tiny batallion and grimaced. He held his tongue though, and handed Stacy II a railgun.

"Great. Xavier, Filbert, grab these cases. Let's go."

Die, heretic scum! Stacy II cackled as she poked her head over the parapet and blasted another volley at the apostates. Her new railgun was _awesome_. 

It didn't take long to score her first kill. Maybe ten minutes? She'd never killed anyone before. She had been worried that it would be a traumatic experience, but as she watched the rebel's torso explode from contact with the projectile, snapping his spine and knocking the life out of his eyes, she felt nothing but pride.

Enemies of the crown beware: Stacy II was on the hunt.

By the end of the morning, she had scored six kills and things were quieting down. She didn't even need to crouch beneath the parapet anymore - the enemies were all so dead or demoralized that she could stand up straight and no one would shoot at her.

They must have gotten the message: Mess with the princess, you'll be in...distress. No - mess with the crown, you're going down.

Stacy II chuckled at herself. That was a good one.

Something moved in the distance. A new target? She raised her railgun up and peered through the sight. It was a truck.

"Who's that?" Russell asked.

"No one good," her mom replied. "Loyalists would be flying the flag."

The truck drove up the road towards the palace.

"Do we shoot it?" Stacy II asked.

"Yes," her mom replied. "Shoot it."

Stacy II opened fire. So did everyone else. The windshield exploded, to reveal an empty cockpit.

The truck was self-driving.

They obliterated the tires and shredded the body, but the self-driving truck trundled forwards on bare steel rims until it came to the huge wooden bridge spanning the palace moat.

"Okay!" shouted Vincent. "Blow the bridge!"

"What?" asked her mom.

Vincent gave her a confused look. "You didn't rig the bridge to explode?"

"Why would I do that?"

"You always rig the bridge to blow, Stacy! This is like, fortifications 101!"

"Well, I didn't take fortifications 101! No one tells me these things!"

The truck crossed the bridge, came to a stop at the enormous gate in the marble wall, and exploded.

Stacy II was thrown off her feet. She knocked her head on the wall and was pelted with shards of marble. The world disappeared for a moment, replaced with a loud ringing noise and clouds of white dust. She hacked and coughed and looked desperately around for the others.

There they were! Everyone was still on the wall - or, what remained of it. A gigantic section of the wall had collapsed. The palace was breached.

"Uh, guys?" asked Filbert.

"We know, Filbert," Russell replied, looking at the gap.

"Not the wall," said Filbert. "Over there." He pointed down the road.

Stacy II looked up. Dirt bikes. A horde of them. The riders were wearing all black and had rifles strapped to their backs. Guess they weren't so demoralized, after all.

"Oh, bollocks," her mom said. She turned to Vincent. "Take the kids and go."

"Screw you Stace," he replied. I'm staying."

She shoved him in the chest. "This isn't your fight. Take the kids and get the hell out of here!"

"Russ?" Vincent asked.

Russell didn't appear to be paying any attention to the discussion. He was busy firing shot after shot at the swarm, once per second, like a machine. "Get out of here, Vince," he said without looking up or breaking rhythm.

Stacy II looked at her mom. She was glaring at Vincent, jaw set, eyes filled with tears.

Vincent nodded and kicked the sole remaining ammo can towards Russell.

"Come on kids," he said. "Let's go."

Stacy II, Vincent, Filbert and Xavier ran along the remaining section of wall, not bothering to crouch for cover behind the parapet. When they reached the elevator, she pressed the button and the doors opened.

Ding! They rushed in.

Stacy II caught a final glimpse of her mother. Her face was pressed into her railgun and she was following Russell's rhythm, blasting shot after shot over the wall.

She prayed her mom would be okay. As the elevator doors, closed, the last thing she heard was the roar of dirtbike engines filling the palace grounds.
