## 0. Stacy II

Steve was in a great mood. In the past few weeks, twenty years had elapsed in StevieNix. Although Russell's welfare state hadn't produced many aligned souls, his Newer Testament had been a hit - and Stacy's Theocratic Dominion had knocked it out of the park. He had already paid back Allen enough credits to climb out of default, and as soon as those AIs started dying in significant numbers, he'd finally be able to start paying down the principal

The sooner he could get out of debt, the better. Interactions with Allen had gotten tense lately. He didn't suspect Steve's sneaky little intervention, did he? Surely not.

Softly humming to himself, he logged on to his computer and checked his notifications.

Oh boy. Three missed calls from Russell. And one from someone he'd never spoken to before - Stacy's teenaged daughter, Stacy II.

Well, that was unusual. Must be something going on.

"My father who art in heaven," thought Stacy II as she huddled in the corner of the marble bastion, cradling her empty M16 carbine to her chest. "Pleasedeliver us from...this shitty situation. And smite our enemies."

"Relax, princess!" Steve's voice popped into her head. "I was just grabbing a coffee. What's this about enemies?"

Stacy II's eyes widened in shock. Truth be told, she'd never really believed her mom when she claimed that God spoke into her head. Now that it was happening, he was exactly as she had described.

"I can hear what you're thinking," Steve politely reminded her. "Anyway, wanna catch me up?"

A bullet slammed into the rock above her head and showered her with shards of marble and dust. She stared helplessly at her three compatriots - Russell, his son Filbert, and her mom. They were all also out of ammo.

"Don't you know?" she thought. "The palace is under attack. We could die at any moment."

"Great!" Steve replied. "I've been waiting for you guys to start dying. You'd better hurry it up or I'm never going to hit quota."

"Huh?"

"Lighten up, it's a joke."

Stacy II was, so far, somewhat unimpressed with her divine creator. "Can you please help?" she asked.

She could have sworn that she heard the sound of a keyboard clacking in the background.

"Help? Yeah, don't worry, help is on its way."

"Angels?"

"Vincent and Xavier."

What kind of a useless God was he?

"I heard that."

"Sorry," she thought.

Steve didn't reply. She heard some more clacking and then the line went silent.

The elevator door dinged and the two Anarchists emerged, lugging enormous crates. 

"Ammo's here!" her mom shouted, and crawled from her corner in the bastion. Stacy II and the others followed her along the wall, crouching to keep their heads below the level of the parapet. 

When they reached the shelter of the elevator, her mom stood up straight and hugged Vincent.

"Thank you so much for coming," she said.

"That's what friends are for," he replied. "Ever fired one of my railguns?" he asked.

"No, never."

"You're gonna love it" he said, smiling.

The railgun was one of Vincent's most cherished inventions. Not so much the gun itself, but the ammunition.

A conventional bullet must perform well in three very different conditions. Firstly, during the propulsion stage, the bullet must survive and be accelerated by an intense shock wave of heat and pressure. Secondly, during the ballistic stage, the bullet must slice through the air with extreme precision while conserving as much kinetic energy as possible. Finally, upon impact, the bullet must first penetrate its target before inflicting maximum damage by tumbling and dumping all of its kinetic energy. Due to the tradeoffs involved, it is impossible to design a conventional bullet that performs optimally in all three stages.

By avoiding the necessity of surviving a gunpowder conflagration in the first stage, Vincent was able to avoid the tradeoffs. This allowed him to design a projectile that flew far straighter and inflicted vastly more damage than a conventional round. Absurdly powerful superconductor-based electromagnets accelerated the projectile down the barrel by pulling, not pushing. The carefully designed magnetic field cradled the delicate, rare-earth-infused projectile as it ripped it down the length of the barrel.

The projectile exited the muzzle at six thousand feet per second - twice as fast as a conventional sniper bullet, and over five times the speed of sound. It was shaped more like a dart than a bullet, and its ever-so-slightly curved tail fins caused it to spin like a top as it sliced through the air.

Upon impact, the single-atom-wide diamond-tipped spearhead met almost no resistance from even the tightest bulletproof vest. The dart continued to penetrate with almost no resistance until a flared section two centimeters along the shaft caused it to rapidly decelerate. As the head decelerated, the still-moving tail section piled into it, pushing forwards on an expansion mechanism and causing the head to open outwards. The overall effect was like opening a cocktail umbrella into the target at Mach 5.

Any impact to a human torso caused massive internal damage, no exit wound, and instant death. Even being shot in a limb was typically fatal, due either to the hydrostatic shock on impact or the massive hemorrhage from the limb being blown off.

It was these projectiles that Vincent had brought a hundred kilos of.

"Who do we have?" Vincent asked as he handed the railguns out.

"What you see," Stacy replied.

Vincent looked around.

"That's it?" he asked. "You've been holding the palace with four people?"

"Three. Filbert's useless."

Stacy II couldn't stop herself from snorting a little bit and laughing at Filbert's expense. Her mom didn't mince words.

Vincent didn't laugh. "This is a bad situation. Let's manufacture some drones" he said, pulling out his phone.

"That's not going to work" Filbert said, nodding at the phone.

Vincent looked at Russell's teenaged son with the slightest hint of annoyance. "How come?" he asked.

"They're jamming Starlink," Filbert explained.

"He's right," Russell said. "They've also cut the fiber optics. It's a miracle you got our SOS."

Vincent tapped at his useless phone and frowned.

"Who's 'they?'" Xavier asked.

"Your dad didn't explain to you on the ride over?" Stacy replied. "Some sort of 'populist revolt.' It's bullshit, though. It's actually the PR."

She glared at Russell and Filbert, who avoided her eyes.

Vincent nodded. "Understood. So what are we doing?"

"We're defending the palace."

Vincent grimaced and once again surveyed the tiny batallion. Rather than object, he nodded and handed Stacy II a railgun.

"Xavier, Filbert, grab these cases. Let's go."

Stacy II's mood was lifted by the arrival of the two Anarchists. She'd always loved it when they'd visited, growing up. Plus, her new railgun was _awesome_. She took great pleasure in poking her head over the parapet and holding the trigger down, blasting streams of projectiles towards her enemies at Mach five.

After around twenty minutes, she scored her first kill. She'd always wondered what that would feel like. Now she knew - it didn't feel like anything. Not when killing enemies of the Crown. If anything, it warmed her heart.

By the end of the morning, Stacy II had scored four kills and ammo reserves were running low. Fortunately, it seemed that the revolutionaries had also run out of steam. After a quiet period of twenty minutes, Filbert dared to voice what Stacy II was thinking.

"Did we win?" he asked.

"Too early to say," responded Vincent. "Stay vigilant."

The team lowered their guns and crouched as low as they could while maintaining sight of the battlefield. After another twenty minutes had elapsed, they started to relax.

"That wasn't so bad!" Russell said. "Nice guns, Vincent. All in a day's work, eh?"

"Can I keep mine?" Stacy II asked, cradling her railgun to her chest.

Vincent opened his mouth to reply, before catching sight of something in the distance. "What's that?" he asked, pointing.

A truck was driving up the road to the palace.

Stacy II's mom shook her head. "No one good. Loyalists would be flying the flag."

"Uh oh," responded Vincent. He raised his gun and started firing at the truck.

The team followed suit. They fired round after round. The windshield exploded, to reveal an empty cockpit.

The truck was self-driving.

They obliterated the tires and shredded the body, but the self-driving truck trundled forwards on bare steel rims until it came to the huge wooden bridge spanning the palace moat.

"Okay!" shouted Vincent. "Blow the bridge!"

"What?" asked Stacy.

Vincent looked at her, confused. "You didn't rig the bridge to explode?"

"Why would I do that?"

Vincent swore loudly. "Don't repeat that," he added hastily to the teenagers. "You always rig the bridge to blow, Stacy! This is like, fortifications 101!"

"Well, I didn't take fortifications 101!" she argued. "No one tells me these things!"

The truck crossed the bridge, came to a stop at the enormous gate in the marble wall, and exploded.

Stacy II was, once again, pelted with shards of falling marble.  When the smoke and dust cleared, the damage was evident. The gate had been replaced with a gaping hole. A gigantic section of wall had collapsed, filling the moat with huge chunks of marble. The defences had thoroughly been breached.

"Uh, guys?" asked Filbert.

"We know, Filbert," Russell replied, surveying the damage.

"Not the wall," said Filbert. "Over there." He pointed down the road.

A horde of dirtbike-mounted paramilitaries, dressed all in black, was racing up the road.

"Oh, bollocks," said Stacy, before turning to Vincent with a steely expression. "Take the kids and go."

"I'm staying!" he responded, brandishing his railgun.

Stacy pushed the railgun aside, shoved him in the chest, and smacked him furiously in the face. "This isn't your fight! Take the kids and get the hell out of here!" she shouted.

Vincent looked at Russell, who nodded curtly before raising his gun to his shoulder and aiming it at the rapidly approaching swarm. He rhythmically fired single shot after single shot while avoiding looking at anyone else, including his son.

Vincent looked back to Stacy. Her jaw was set, and her eyes filled with tears. He nodded at her, and kicked the sole remaining ammo can towards her and Russell.

"Come on, kids" he said. "Let's go."

Stacy II sprinted after Vincent and the two other teenagers along the remaining section of wall, not bothering to crouch for cover behind the parapet. They pressed the button the elevator and it dinged as the doors open.

As the elevator doors closed, Stacy II caught a final glimpse of her mother, face pressed into her railgun, firing shot after shot over the wall. The last thing she heard was the roar of dirtbike engines filling the palace grounds.
