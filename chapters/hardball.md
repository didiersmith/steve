Steve spent a week shaving every unnecessary piece of code off the VR interface he could find. It wasn't enough. He and Gabe were still far short of the credits necessary to execute the plan. Together, they humbly approached the one contestant with credits to spare.

Allen nearly laughed them out of his office.

"Let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly", he snorted. "You two idiots are on the cusp of bankruptcy. Your plan is to perform a last-ditch intervention to unify your tribes and undermine my meme - the most successful meme ever to grace this sim - and you want me to fund it?"

"Your meme is on the verge of collapse anyway", snapped Steve. "You're stretched too thin. Your yields are decelerating. People bought into your stupid incestuous gods when things were improving, but now they're just paying lip service."

Allen stopped laughing and gave Steve a withering glare. Steve deduced that he wasn't used to being spoken to that way.

"What do you propose?" Allen asked.

Steve launched into his pitch. "Maurice Allen. You're a businessman, right?"

"Cut the crap, Steve."

Steve cut the crap. "Shares. We'll give you ten percent of all credits we earn off this meme in exchange for your investment."

"And what size investment would that be?"

Steve named his number.

Allen burst out laughing again. "You realize what kind of valuation you've given yourself? To have any hope of generating ROI, this would have not only have to kill my cash cow, but also become the most successful meme in all of StevieNix history!"

Steve sighed. Gabe looked at his shoes. Allen clicked his pen.

"Does that ten percent come with voting rights?" Allen asked.

"No" responded Steve.

Allen clicked his pen a few more times.

"I want eighty percent."

Steve and Gabe looked at each other in shock. At eighty percent, they would effectively be working for Allen.

"Absolutely not," Steve responded.

"Your other option is bankruptcy", Allen said.

"Our other option," Steve fired back coldly, "is sabotage."

The hundred thousand year old steely-eyed tycoon across the table leaned forwards and rested on his elbows. "Eternal Spring", he enunciated slowly and clearly, "is extremely proud of our commitment to quality. You can live for as long as you like, secure in your knowledge that our vitamins are six nines reliable. That's ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent reliable. Do you have any idea how hard it is to make anything that reliable?"

Steve and Gabe sat in silence, unsure of how to respond or where Allen was going with this.

"Of course", Allen continued, "there is still that point zero zero zero one percent." He looked at Steve pointedly, then shifted his glare over to Gabe, and finally back to Steve.

Steve felt stupid. In retrospect, attempting to hardball the man responsible for keeping him alive was a very bad idea.

"We'll settle for forty percent", piped in Gabe, unprompted and without authorization.

"Sixty-five", responded Allen plainly. "That's my final offer. Take it, or get the hell out of my office."

Within a couple of hours, a contract had been signed and the credits had been transferred. Steve and Gabe had been humiliated, but were back in the game.

Steve got to work. Against the protests of the other contestants, he started by slowing down time considerably. He chose his ancestral/monotheistic hybrid tribe as his entry point, sparked a couple of memes to prophesize his arrival, and dove in.

Once in, his actions were quite simple. He alternated between disseminating his new meme, and performing miracles.

The miracles were much smaller than they had been during the fire and brimstone days, but carefully optimized for maximum loyalty gained per intervention credit spent. He and Gabe had run the numbers and determined that healing apes from disease was the highest value intervention - news of the miraculous healer spread rapidly throughout the region. Before long there were apes traveling from every tribe in the area, diseased relatives in tow. He settled into a routine - heal, preach, sleep.

Hes new meme was a radical shift. While still retaining some warfaring elements, he downplayed conflict to focus on alignment, and spreading the meme.

The alignment message was extremely straightforward. The AIs were to love Steve like a family member. If they did so sufficiently, they would be rewarded with eternal life. What eternal life looked like in practice, he left deliberately underspecified - the apes filled in the gaps with their own imaginations. None of them guessed "packed onto an interstellar warship with enough materiel to destroy a solar system," but that didn't bother Steve.

Most of his time was spent lecturing on the importance of, and strategies for, spreading the meme. Although he still advocated violence in extreme circumstances, he instructed his adherents to tone it way, way down. Instead, he emphasized the importance of soft power. It was less costly, he taught, to win adherents through kindness and generosity. Apes, like everyone, loved free stuff.

After spending a full week in VR - amounting to three years in sim - he delivered his final message. To demonstrate the level of love he expected from his adherents, he had his avatar brutally executed "on their behalf". Then, to really hammer the point of his divinity home, he respawned and spent a short while walking around and showing off his resurrection ability. The apes were flabbergasted.

Finally, Steve spent the last of his borrowed intervention credits shooting his avatar up into the skies on an impressive plume of smoke and light. Once he'd disappeared from view, Steve logged off. He removed his VR headset and collapsed onto the couch, exhausted. He and Gabe were officially broke, but the work was done.
