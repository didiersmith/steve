## 0. The Fall

"You're insane," Gabe informed him. "You can't seriously consider this."

"Why not?" Steve asked. "He made a compelling argument."

"He violated like a dozen speech ordinances."

"He quoted the title of my thesis. No one's done that in centuries."

"You'd be giving up a thousand-year academic career and a tenured position!"

"I'll just take a sabbatical. How long could this possibly take?"

Gabe sighed and returned to his meatball sub. Steve re-read his offer letter.

If Steve were honest with himself, even he had to admit that StevieNix wasn't the best universe in the world. Some of the larger software companies had produced truly majestic simulations with poetry-composing AIs and Newtonian physics at every scale. StevieNix, on the other hand, glitched out whenever someone ran the microwave.

Steve's universe did have two things going for it. The first, was that it was open source. Anyone could contribute patches to it, and many did. Over the centuries, this had resulted in an extremely rich (if somewhat eclectic) biodiversity - from wing-headed sharks, to birds with beautiful but ridiculous tails, to Steve's personal favourite - apes that stood upright and walked like him.

The second thing was the sexual reproduction mechanic - the subject of Steve's PhD thesis. The industry standard approach to genetic engineering was top-down guided evolution, where engineers played a critical role in selecting the next generation. In _Sexual Reproduction - A Meta-Meta Heuristic Algorithm for Genetic Optimization_, Steve had flipped the paradigm on its head. By introducing a bottom-up mechanism wherein the beings not only cross-pollinated their genetic material but selected their own breeding partners, Steve had revolutionized the field.

At least, that's the way he saw it. Mostly, the sexual reproduction mechanic resulted in his beings becoming obsessed with proliferating their own genetic material at the cost of more productive pursuits. Hence, the jokes.

Thus, when Murdoch walked into the break room and quoted his thesis title at him, Steve took it as a centuries-overdue recognition of his genius. He had no choice, really. He was fated to ignore Murdoch's casual disregard for the law and take up residence at Murdoch Heavy Industries.

Gabe followed in his footsteps, a couple weeks later. "To keep you out of trouble," he explained.

Steve heard Gabe whistle as he walked into the datacenter.

"Look at these!" the astronomer exclaimed, gesturing at the rows of perfectly uniform, black servers. "Bit of an upgrade, eh?"

"They're MHI-10s," Steve beamed. "Murdoch Heavy Industries' state of the art particle computers. You can't even buy them yet."

"Does StevieNix even run on them?"

"No. I have to port all the code. Particle computers are weird, man."

It took months for Steve to port StevieNix to the datacenter. Murdoch was fairly hands-off during this period. Once the code was working, however, he took a keen interest.

"You need to make them smarter," he insisted. "We need AIs that can fly warships, not...what are they doing?"

Steve looked at where Murdoch was pointing. "Those two? They're...ah...communicating their genetic material."

Murdoch gave Steve a look and walked out of his office. "Smarter!" he called as he receded down the hallway.

Steve looked at Gabe for advice. Gabe shrugged.

Intelligence, Steve found, wasn't always a reproductive asset. For whatever reason, every time he engineered a smart ape, they decided to apply their intelligence to esoteric hobbies instead of making huge numbers of offspring. Steve's hand-written intelligence genes were invariably wiped out within a few generations.

Murdoch didn't say anything when Steve announced his latest failed experiment, but Steve could tell he was getting impatient.

Later, in Steve's office, Gabe had a suggestion. "What if, instead of trying to engineer their genes, you engineer their environment?"

"How so?" asked Steve.

"Lean harder on the evolution mechanic. You're barely using any of this compute power. Spin up a couple million of these monkeys, and subject them to brutal evolutionary pressure. Come back in a week. If any of those poor apes are still alive, I bet they'll be pretty smart."

Steve pondered his suggestion. Not a bad idea. He felt bad for his apes, but not bad enough not to try it. But what would qualify as brutal evolutionary pressure?

He settled on snakes - it was a lot easier to make a scary snake than a smart monkey. He produced endless varieties of snakes. Snakes that hid in trees. Venomous snakes. Gargantuan snakes that could wrap around an ape, crush it to death, and swallow it whole. Snake predation became the number one killer of his apes.

The changes were small at first, but he watched them compound. First, the apes developed extremely keen vision, with full colour and depth perception. Then, they developed something amazing - a primitive language, which they used to communicate about the presence of snakes. Steve learned the language, and sent more snakes.

The apes responded by developing an entire theory of snakes - which ones were venomous, which ones were harmless, where and when you might encounter them, etc. They were getting smarter.

One day, as Steve was listening to an older ape explain snake theory to a younger ape, he heard something that astonished him.

"If you see a little brown snake, run away" explained the elder ape. So far, so good.

"Why?" asked the younger ape. "Can't I just drop a rock on it or something?"

Steve jacked out of VR and sat in slack-jawed wonder. In order to ask that question, the younger ape had to be doing something incredible. He had to run a hypothetical simulation in his mind, of himself confronting a future snake. The ape was self-aware.

By setting out to create smarter apes, Steve had accidentally achieved something else entirely. His apes were sentient.

Unfortunately, they were still pretty dumb.
