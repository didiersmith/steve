## 0. Remarkable Progress

Ever since Steve's decision to bend the rules, Murdoch had enjoyed hanging out with him a lot more. It was like something inside him had snapped. The stick up his butt, perhaps.

"So you're just going to let Russ create the dumbest form of government ever?" Murdoch asked.

Steve blushed. "You don't know that! These apes can surprise you."

"What, you think they can come up with something even dumber?"

"That's not what I meant."

Murdoch laughed. Steve was so easy to wind up. He lookad at the bird's eye view of StevieNix on Steve's monitor, and pointed at Stacy's territory. "What's she up to?"

"She's calling it the 'Theocratic Dominion.' TD for short."

"Sounds promising."

"It is. The other apes think she's a prophet. She's leveraged that into a divine right to rule. She acts as judge and legislator."

"Legislator, eh?" Murdoch asked. "What are her rules?" 

"The usual stuff. No robbing, killing, sexual assault. Strict adherence to my meme. Also, no importing weird chemicals."

"What does she do to people who disobey?"

"Death or transportation."

Death made sense. But transportation? Murdoch cocked his head and looked at Steve, inviting him to elaborate.

"After she convicts them, she flips a coin. Heads, hanging. Tails, one-way hyperloop trip to New Australia."

"New Australia?"

"She had Vincent build her an island. No guards, just wilderness and criminals."

Ah. A penal colony. "Sounds horrendous," Murdoch said.

Steve nodded. "Yeah, I wouldn't want to be sent there myself. But the threat sure helps keep them aligned."

"I bet it does," Murdoch said. "And people actually go for this?"

Steve clicked around brought up a stats pane. "A decent chunk of them do," he said, pointing at a column of numbers. "For anyone who wants to be aligned and live in a safe country, it's hard to beat. Most people go to the PR though."

"PR?"

"People's Republic. Russell's place."

Murdoch laughed. No way. "Russell's direct democracy welfare state?"

"Yup."

"That place is a catastrophe waiting to happen."

"It's quite popular."

"I bet it is. Walk me through it."

Steve panned the viewport over to Russell's PR. It looked like Russell had tried his own hand at island design, as well. Rather than adopt Vincent's hexagons, he'd built one single enormous island, complete with hills, cities, towns and farmland. It looked quite idyllic, actually.

"Basically, Russell has a huge fleet of mining worms that dig gold out of the sea floor. He hands the gold out to people to reward them for living on his island. All the manual labour gets done by robots, so the people mostly just...sit around, I guess."

"Was sitting around part of the AI design spec? Aligned and lazy?"

Steve blushed and changed the subject. "How's your islander going?"

Murdoch smiled a wicked grin. "Couldn't be better."

Murdoch sat alone in his office, reading a letter and smoking. He had received two letters today.

The first letter had borne welcome news: Murdoch Heavy Industry had won the tender! Winning the contract to build the interstellar radio was a _sine qua non_ of his plan - there was simply no other way to hide the necessary amount of industrial activity from FEDSEC.

The second letter, on the other hand, was the one he was reading now. Murdoch muttered under his breath as he scanned through.

"Dear Mr. Murdoch...Our significant financial stake reflects MHI's exemplary track record...blah blah blah, bullshit, bullshit...recent investments...inadvisable...significant departure from the disciplined approach that previously drove shareholder value."

Ah, feck. It was a threat. Murdoch skipped to the bottom.

"We look forward to partnering collaboratively with management to address these strategic concerns before they significantly impact long-term value creation. Sincerely, Prescott Whitmore, Chairman and CEO, Whitmore Strategic Partners."

Prescott feckin' Whitmore. The mutinous gobshite was threatening to knife him in the gut. Feck, feck, feck.

Murdoch rested his cigarette carefully on the ashtray and continued muttering as he typed a response. "Feckin'...‘perfectly valid concerns’...feckin'...‘deep value creation’...‘utmost respect for our esteemed shareholder communty’...feckin'...arseholes."

He re-read his response. It looked okay. Should buy him until the end of the quarter. He glanced at his calendar. Ten weeks left. Feckin' Vincent better get his shit together, pronto.

He emailed his response to Whitmore Strategic Partners and flicked over to StevieNix to see what his islanders were up to.

Vincent's Anarchy was the least popular of the three territories. Only the bravest chose to emigrate there.

The cornerstone of Vincent's moral code was the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) - the idea that it's immoral to _initiate_ violence. As governments could only exist by initiating violence (taxation), he considered them to be unethical constructs -  the only moral government, was no government at all.

Of course, once violence was _initiated_...well, it was on the table. Any means at all could be justified to take it off - up to, and including, vigilante execution. In fact, Vincent considered thoughtful participation in vigilante lynch mobs (only against NAP-violators!) to be a courageous exercise of civic duty.

In practice, lynchings were rare - partially they worked, and partially because Vincent filtered out any immigration applicants that he considered even remotely problematic.

His internal monologue played out over Murdoch's desktop speakers.

"Twenty-two years old, male, tattoos, looks like he might get a little handsy...bin."

"Thirty-one years old, female, pirk hair...bin."

"Twenty-six, male, welfare recipient...bin."

Murdoch was surprised that Vincent allowed anybody in at all. He dragged the speed slider up and skipped forward a couple months.

Whoa, that was a lot of islands. What happened? He zoomed in on Vincent, who was sitting in a...board room? Watching a slide deck?

Murdoch absent-mindedly lit another cigarette as he tried to piece the story together. Vincent was being pitched to. Some group who called themselves the 'Whale Fund' wanted a canton, whatever that was.

Good luck to them. Murdoch sped the sim up and zoomed out. Vincent left the board room, returned to his crew, and they built dozens of those hexagonal islands. They joined them together, and...gave them to the Whale Fund?

So that's what a canton is.

Murdoch sped the sim up more. The Whale Fund was some sort of live-in startup accelerator. Neat. Vincent and his crew cranked out canton after canton and pushed them out into the Pacific. The hexagonal building blocks made them endlessly reconfigurable - occasionally, cantons would split up, or join together...sometimes, individual islands declared themselves to be independent entities and just floated off by themselves.

Not bad, monkey.

Eyes glued to the screen, he absent-mindedly reached in his top drawer for his bottle of scotch. He took the lid off, poured, and - ah, shit. Empty. Could this day get any worse?

Just then, his office door burst open and Allen walked in.

"Steve's cheating!" Allen said.

Goddamn it. He shouldn't have asked. "What do you mean?"

"He's flat broke. Can't afford to do anything. And yet, somehow, his apes have managed to invent several centuries' worth of technology in like what, two weeks?"

"We've been overclocking the sim. Company decision."

Allen shook his head. "It's still too fast. It's only been a couple years in StevieNix. This rate of advancement is impossible."

"Clever apes. They've made remarkable progress."

"It reeks of divine intervention!"

"Sounds circumstantial."

Allen glared at Murdoch. He wasn't buying it.

"Why do you care anyway?" Murdoch asked. "You get all his aligned souls. Don't you want him to succeed?"

"I only want him to succeed a little! Obviously not so much that he climbs out of default!"

God fecking damnit. First, Whitmore Strategic Partners. Now, Maurice Allen. Why did everyone need to be a problem? At least Whitmore was in the dark about it all - Allen had no excuse.

Murdoch sighed. "It's just a stupid competition, Maurice. You have to remember the big picture."

"It's the principle of it!"

"Goddamn it, Maurice!" Murdoch snapped, thumping the table. "Will you drop it? Forget the competition! Don't you remember what we're doing here? These monkeys are our ticket off of Elba!"

Allen's eyes narrowed. He examined Murdoch's face. "You know!" he said. "Steve's cheating and you know about it!"

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

Allen scowled and stomped to the door.

"Fuck you!" he yelled. "Fuck Steve's stupid meme and his stupid islands! New Sealand is done!" He strode out and slammed the door.

Murdoch stared at the door for a while as Allen's footsteps receded down the hallway. What was all that about?

Was Allen senile?

He shrugged and turned back to the screen. One problem at a time. 

He absent-mindedly set a breakpoint, sped up the sim, and walked down to the liquor store.

When he returned, twenty years had elapsed.
