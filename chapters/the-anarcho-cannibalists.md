## 0. The Anarcho-Cannibalists

"How many rounds do you have left?" Stacy II asked Filbert, once her newly-pledged crowd had dispersed from the square.

"Six," Filbert responded curtly.

Stacy II nodded. "I have ten." 

Filbert looked at her and nodded back, silently. Sixteen was not a large number of rounds with which to conquer and subdue thousands of hardened, savage criminals. 

"You know," he said, "I was never going to shoot that guy."

Stacy II glared at him. "Which guy?" she asked.

"The guy who was pointing out that you're not in charge of anything."

Stacy II kicked a twig that had been lying on the ground. It spun off and came to rest next to a hut, which, upon further inspection, Filbert realized shared more in common with a yurt or a ger than what he would traditionally consider a 'hut'. He'd have to ask Archibald what to call their dwellings.

"Filbert," Stacy II said slowly, "You have to kill whoever I ask you to. It's part of the deal."

"What deal?" he complained. "You never gave me a deal. You just strong-armed me into flying with you to this dump and now you're ordering me to kill innocent people."

"No one here is innocent!" Stacy II hissed. "Didn't you see what he was about to do to Archibald's mother? How much 'public property' do you think this guy has availed himself of in the past? I could have you shoot every man on the island and the moral balance of the universe would improve!"

"Good thing we don't have enough ammo for that," Filbert replied snarkily.

"No," Stacy II agreed. "We don't. God willing, we have just enough ammo to bluff our way to victory by the skin of our teeth. Let's hope, for both our sakes, that our reputation precedes us and you don't have to shoot anyone else."

They spent the night at Archibald's place. It was the least comfortable night of Stacy II's life, not least because their host family didn't have any spare bedding, but because Archibald and his mother were both inexplicably mourning the loss of his stepfather.

"But he was turning you over to be gang-raped by a mob of degenerate criminals," Stacy II objected, over the sounds of his mother's wailing.

"He was the best husband I ever had!" she replied between sobs. "Who's going to take care of my family now?"

"He had rented your son out and was about to marry your twelve-year-old daughter," Stacy II pointed out incredulously. "How could someone possibly take worse care of your family?"

The wailing became shrieking. Filbert dragged Stacy II away from the table before she did any more damage. She attempted to go to sleep on the floor while Filbert kept watch.

"So, what do you call this kind of building?" Filbert asked Archibald, gesturing towards the animal hide ceiling of the single-room abode. "I can't decide between hut, yurt, or ger."

Archibald looked at him with a confused expression.

"It's a house," he answered simply.

"Ah, right," Filbert replied. "A house. Of course. Thank you."

Archibald squinted at him in suspicion and retired to his raised sleeping platform next to the wall. Filbert sat down next to Stacy II, tucked the railguns under his knees, and tried to stay awake through the long, cold night.

******

As Stacy II had hoped, news of her conquest had already reached the neighbouring village by the next morning. Unfortunately, they seemed to consider the rumours to be a joke or a ploy, and didn't react cordially to the sight of her and their neighbouring tribesmen showing up unannounced, armed for combat. A welcoming committee was assembled, comprised of every able-bodied man in the village, armed with bows and arrows.

Stacy II and her troupe paused their march as they reached the edge of the clearing separating them from the village and saw the archers. She looked back at her own men, each of whom was holding either a club or a spear. "They have bows and arrows?" she asked.

"Yeah, but they're crap," replied Archibald. "It's cowardly, shooting sticks at people from a distance. No honour in it, you know?"

"Are they crap because they're ineffective, or crap because they're dishonourable?"

"Dishonourable. They're very effective."

Stacy II swore. She'd conquered the idiot village.

"Okay, here's the plan. You lot retreat into the bush. You," she nodded at Filbert, "get ready to shoot on my signal." With that, she turned and marched alone, railgun slung across her back, through the clearing.

Filbert groaned and settled into the prone firing position. He peered through his iron sights at the archers across the clearing. As usual, Stacy II was acting with total disregard for the cleanliness of his shot, and was blocking half the field as she walked directly towards the targets. She also hadn't told him what the signal would be, or whom to shoot.

Archibald looked down at Filbert lying in the mud, and scoffed. "That's dishonourable too," he remarked.

Filbert ignored him. Stacy II had reached the halfway point of the clearing, and a tall, muscular representative of the other village had come out to meet her. They stopped a couple of meters from each other and started to exchange words. Filbert couldn't hear the conversation, and mostly wished that Stacy II would move a couple of meters to either side, away from his shot. He tried to deduce the conversation from their body language. The man was standing tall, with his arms folded across his chest. Stacy II was passionately attempting to persuade him of something (presumably the benefits of submitting to her rule), punctuating her speech with enthusiastic gesticulations, which Filbert chose not to interpret as signals to fire. Then, they exchanged roles - the man spoke with wide, sweeping gestures and Stacy II listened patiently with her hands on her hips.

After what felt like a century, Stacy II turned and stomped back across the clearing. "Why didn't you shoot him?" she demanded, as she came within earshot.

"You didn't signal!" Filbert objected.

"What did you think this was?" she asked, making one of the many gestures she'd displayed in the conversation.

Filbert grumbled. There was no point in arguing.

"So what's the deal?" he asked.

"No deal," Stacy II responded. She folded her arms and put on a deep caveman voice, in mockery of her counterparty. "We anarcho-cannibalist society. We ruled by no man. Or woman, for that matter."

"Anarcho-cannibalist?" Filbert asked.

Stacy II nodded and continued the voice. "Eat people is restorative justice. Restore nutrients to collective. Serve justice, medium rare."

Archibald, piped up. "What do you mean, ruled by no man? What about the House of Lords?"

Stacy II broke character and replied in her normal voice. "I had the same question. He said the last time the House of Lords sent a tax collector, they ate him, and sent back a shrunken head. They haven't been taxed in over a decade."

Archibald nodded thoughtfully. Discomforted by his evident interest in this novel political arrangement, Stacy II continued talking before he or his tribe had the chance to seriously consider the merits of anarcho-cannibalism.

"So naturally, we need to kill them all and raze their village to the ground," she said.

"The Genghis Khan response, eh?" Filbert asked, giving her a pointed look and gesturing subtly towards his railgun magazine. "Sounds inefficient."

"It was very efficient!" Stacy II objected. "Half of the cities the Mongols took surrendered without a fight."

"Sounds like something we can try after we've got the archers on our side."

"What do you suggest?"

"You have to win their hearts and minds," Filbert suggested.

Stacy II scoffed. "How do you win the hearts and minds of a tribe of savage cannibals?"

"I dunno," Filbert pondered. "Feed them someone, maybe?"

"Who would we feed them?" Stacy II asked, looking at her troops, who were slowly retreating backwards into the undergrowth.

"Do you reckon they'd eat one of their own?" Filbert wondered, wary of the fragility of their newly forged alliance. Two of Archibald's people had already been eaten in the past twenty-four hours. Best not to push it.

"Might be worth a shot," Stacy II replied, performing the same strategic calculus. "We'd need to gussy it up a little in restorative justice. Wait - what am I saying? Even if we won their hearts and minds, there's no way we'd ever be able to integrate cannibals back into TD society."

Filbert shrugged.

Stacy II shook her head. "I'm not doing it. I won't make a deal with them. There's only one way to deal with a tribe of cannibals, and it rhymes with 'venocide.'"

Archibald butted in. "You're going to kill all the deer?"

Stacy II and Filbert sighed simultaneously.

A voice interrupted with an accent that sounded like it belonged to an Etonian in the Victorian Era. "If I may so rudely interject," it began.

Stacy II and Filbert swiveled round. The voice belonged to Blake, the celebrated chandler and goat wrestler.

"Perhaps your strategic interests would be better served, your royal highness, by giving greater consideration to the order of operations?"

"Can you be more specific?" Stacy II asked.

"Certainly. This young clodpoll," he gestured at Archibald, who scowled in return, "has led you to what would surely be the most difficult-to-conquer tribe in the entire region. They have us outnumbered, outgunned, and out...belligerenced."

Stacy II's eyes narrowed. She was beginning to suspect that the accent was put on. Still, she allowed him to continue.

"Would it not make more sense," asked Blake, "to start by vanquishing some lesser foes, and then circle back round for a cheeky 'venocide' after we've swollen our ranks?"

Stacy II looked at Filbert, who nodded. "It makes sense. If we come back with a big enough army, there might not be any fighting at all."

"And perhaps we can find some bows and arrows," Stacy II added, glaring at Archibald. "Do you have a target in mind?" she asked Blake.

"If it were me, your royal highness, I'd start with the pacifists."

A round of laughter and excited chattering sprang from the crowd at the mention of the pacifists. The army seemed much more enthralled by the idea of conquering them than the An-Cans.

"There are pacifists on New Australia?" she asked, incredulously. "Why haven't you conquered them already?"

Blake looked at her, confused, and forgot to put on his accent. His actual accent sounded like it belonged to a chav from Yorkshire, three generations removed from employment. "Because we're civilized folk who don't go about conquerin' everyone all the time, that's why! You're the only one wot goes on talkin' about conquerin' all the time. We just raid 'em every once in a while. No use conquerin' 'em once if it means you can't raid 'em in the future." His eyes widened as he realized his mistake, and he added "your most esteemed majesty" in his Etonian impression. The crowd snickered.

"Is he right?" Stacy II asked a random member of the troupe, who was leaning on a tree and playing with his spear. The man looked up. "About what?"

"That there's a tribe of pacifists in the area that would be easy to conquer, and the only reason you haven't done it yet is because you want to keep them around to periodically raid them."

"Oh yeah," the man agreed. "The pacifists are great. Total pushovers. I got this spear off them," he said proudly, holding the spear out so Stacy II could admire the craftsmanship.

Stacy II wasn't particularly impressed. It was a pointy stick. Still, this seemed like a much better plan. "Right," she announced. "That settles it. We're going to conquer the pacifists."

The army cheered.
