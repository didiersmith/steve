## 0. Xavier

Xavier looked up from his Austrian Economics textbook, across the dining room table to his dad who had assigned it. Something wasn't adding up.

"Hey dad," he asked. "Why does no one else build islands?"

"They can't," Vincent replied, dipping a piece of buttered sourdough into his egg. "No nanoscale tech."

"So you have a monopoly?"

His dad gave him a slight glare as he chewed and swallowed his mouthful. "I give the islands away, Xavier. For free."

"So you just allocate islands based on vibes? The invisible hand of the market doesn't get a say?"

"Your econ unit is for your educational enrichment, kiddo. Not for you to be a pain in my ass."

"Doesn't seem very, you know. Aligned with free market principles."

His dad ignored him and took another bite of his breakfast. Maybe he'd given the old man enough grief for one morning. Plus, his dad's economic hypocrisy wasn't the main thing he was curious about.

"Why do you spend so much effort building these islands just to give them away?" Xavier asked. "Why not just give away the nanoscale tech and let people build them for themselves?"

His dad finished another mouthful of toast and eggs, and washed it down with a swig of black coffee. "The technology to build islands," he replied, "rests on a technology too powerful for humans to handle."

Almost there. Just one more step. "You mean the computer?"

His dad raised an eyebrow.

"The MHI-10?" Xavier asked.

"Who told you about the MHI-10?"

Got him. "Everyone knows about the MHI-10, dad."

"No, they don't."

"There's a referendum about it in the PR."

"No, there isn't."

Xavier unlocked his phone and slid it across the table. His dad picked it up and a dark cloud descended over his face as he read the referendum.

"The Freedom of Knowledge Act. Democratize access to the MHI-10."

"It's at seventy one percent in favour."

"This isn't good."

"You don't like it?"

"How do they think they're going to gain access to the computer? There are only three people alive, who...oh. We need to triple security."

"Sure, whatever." Xavier didn't like the way his dad looked right now and was keen to move on to the idea that had been looping through his mind. "Anyway, I had a thought."

"What's that?"

"Why can't you use the MHI-10 to build nanoscale tech that doesn't rely on the MHI-10? Then you can democratize that."

His dad sat in silence for quite a few moments. Xavier was starting to worry that he'd suffered a stroke, when -

"Do you want to give it a shot?" Vincent asked. "We'll add it to your engineering curriculum."

Oh. That was unexpected.

"Yes!" he said.

"Then put down that goddamn econ textbook and follow me. Time for you to learn something useful."

His dad got up, grabbed his plate, and wandered towards the lab. Xavier picked up his own breakfast and rushed after him.

How the hell do you coordinate a trillion robots, without relying on omniscience? Jeez, his dad had had it easy. Xavier looked at his latest failure, a formless ooze of carbon. This sucked.

"Your computer is too far away from the robots," said a voice in his head. "Communications lag is screwing you."

Xavier froze. Why was he thinking in an Irish accent?

"Here's an idea: Whenever you want to build something, start by building a computer in its shape. Like a skeleton of transistors. Then use that computer to coordinate the robots as they flesh it out."

Xavier shook the voice out of his head. He must have thought so hard on the project that he was starting to drive himself insane. This was probably his brain telling him that it was time to go to sleep.

He slept on the couch in the lab. When he woke up, the voice was still there.

"Feck lad, will you hurry up? We haven't got all day!"

Jeez, okay then. Xavier stumbled to his desk and started designing a circuit.

---

It took months. If he hadn't had the LLM, his dad's nanoscale fabrication robots and the weird Irish voice in his head, he'd never have pulled it off.

The Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) was huge - roughly the size and shape of an oak tree. The unfathomably complex lattice of carbon, silicon and rare earth metals was submerged in an enormous tank of cooling liquid and easily qualified as the most complex machine on Earth. It had one purpose: To transform a digital blueprint - a CAD design - into a computer. A skeleton of transistors, just like the voice had said. 

"What are you doing?" asked the now-familiar Irish voice in his head.

"I'm thinking it through."

"No you're not, you're being a little pansy."

Xavier shook his head, steeled his nerves, and pressed the power button. The ASIC turned on for the first time. The transistors hummed and the cooling liquid began to swirl around the tank.

"Was that so hard?"

"Shut up."

Okay, it turned on. But did it actually work? He walked over to his desk and brought up his dad's CAD software. Under the 'manufacturing' tab, there was a 3D render of the lab. He dragged a five centimeter sphere onto his virtual desk, made sure the output was set to the ASIC, and clicked "run".

He stared at his desk. Nothing was happening.

"A bit of an anticlimax," the voice said.

"I thought I told you to shut up."

"Feck you lad, do you even know who I am?"

Whatever. A thin trickle of robots had appeared, flowing like a line of miniscule ants from the ASIC to the center of his desk. Their terminus on his desk was growing tendrils into the air. Tiny threads were blossoming upwards, branching and joining each other into a near-invisible spherical web. The transistor skeleton.

It was working.

The robot supply chain bulged with an influx of black and silver mass. The flowing robot swarm subsumed the transistor skeleton for a few moments before receding like the tide, leaving a perfectly spherical black ball where the web had been moments before.

Xavier picked it up and rolled it between his fingers. A perfect sphere, five centimeters in diameter. Carbon black. The ASIC worked.

"Alright, not bad."

Not bad indeed.

The door burst open and his dad ran in.

"Hey dad!" Xavier yelled, running up to him. "It worked! Look!"

He handed the black sphere to his dad, who looked down at it speechless for a few seconds.

"The ASIC made this?" he asked.

"Yeah!"

His dad looked at him with a weird expression. Some mixture of pride and...deep concern?

"Do you understand how dangerous this is?" he asked.

Oh, just old man feelings. Xavier laughed and ran back to his computer. "I'm gonna make a skateboard!"

"Not right now, you're not!"

"Huh?"

"Get your jacket on and meet me at the hyperloop station in two minutes. We're going to Stacy's."

"What, now? Do I have to come?"

"Yes, you have to come."

"I've just made the biggest technological advance in two decades and you want me to go to a stupid dinner party?"

"You haven't been reading the news, have you?"

"No, why?"

His dad sighed. "You need to pay attention to what's going on outside your lab. There's more to life than circuits."

Xavier rolled his eyes.

"New Sealand has gone to hell," his dad continued. "The PR's bankrupt. Russell's fled to Stacy's palace. A revolution's kicked off in the TD and rebels are threatening to lynch them. Let's go."

Oh.

"What are we supposed to do?" Xavier asked.

"Not sure. But when your mates need help, you help."

As they ran to their family's personal hyperloop station, the voice shared its opinions.

"Where the feck are you going?"

"Family business," Xavier thought back.

"Your family business is nanoscale manufacturing! Get back in the lab!"

They reached the station and his dad opened a trap door built into the floor. "Xavier! Stop gawking and help me!" he shouted as he pulled railguns and ammunition out of the micro-armory.

"Sorry," Xavier thought as he loaded the weapons into the hyperloop shuttle. "I don't even know who you are."
