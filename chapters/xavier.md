## 0. Xavier

A thought occurred to Xavier as he was working through the Austrian Economics homework his father had assigned him. "Hey dad", he asked, "why does no one else build new islands?"

Vincent put down his phone and peered over the table at his teenaged son. "What do you mean?" he responded. "We have a whole crew building the islands. Each island takes at least forty people, and we usually have a dozen going at once."

"Right," Xavier responded, "but it's only your crew, which means you have a stranglehold on the market. You could charge as much as you like to build an island. Therefore pricing must be inefficient. It's a moral duty of the market to kneecap you until competitors have the opportunity to emerge."

"I don't charge for the islands at all," his dad objected.

"Even worse! You just allocate islands based on vibes! The market price of a new canton is a suitably manipulative pitch deck. You know there are companies out there that specialize in helping would-be canton founders prepare pitch decks for you?"

"You're making me regret adding econ to your homeschool curriculum."

Xavier continued. "Do you have any idea how much those companies charge to prepare a deck? There's basically a black market price on new cantons."

"Are you suggesting I start charging for cantons?" asked Vincent.

"No," replied Xavier. "Not without competition - there'd be no way for you to discover a fair market price. I'm suggesting you democratize the island-creating technology and let a free market emerge."

"Absolutely not!" his dad replied. "No way in hell!"

"Why not?"

"The technology to build islands rests on a technology too powerful for humans to handle."

Although his dad was trying to be coy, Xavier knew what he was talking about. "You mean the computer?" he asked. "The MHI-10?"

His dad visibly winced. "Who told you about the MHI-10?"

"Everyone knows about the MHI-10, dad."

"How? We never told anyone about it."

"So there IS an MHI-10?"

Vincent swore. "Don't repeat that," he added, hastily. "Let this be a lesson to you. Never trust anyone with anything."

"There's a referendum about it in the People's Republic."

"_What?_"

Xavier pushed his phone across the table. It displayed his social media feed, plastered with post after post of People's Republicans complaining about their lack of access to the computer.

"Elitist assholes, prolly sitting in their mansions jerking off, spying on the rest of us while we do all the REAL WORK!" read a representative sample.

"Russell wants to pretend he's one of us, meanwhile he's sitting on a pile of gold the size of parliament! Let them eat cake, motherf--"

"Morons," responded Vincent and pushed the phone back.

"They're going to win," said Xavier. "The referendum's at 71% for."

"What's the wording?"

"The Freedom of Knowledge Act. Democratize access to the MHI-10 supercomputer, for the common good of humanity."

Vincent rolled his eyes. "They have no idea what they're asking for. How are they even going to enforce that? The only people with access are Stacy, Russell, and myself." He thought for a second, then realized. "Oh. Remind me to triple security."

"Anyway," said Xavier, "we were talking about the islands."

"I already answered your question. The computer is too dangerous."

"Why can't you use the computer to build fab technology that doesn't rely on the computer? Then you can democratize that."

He could sense his dad's annoyance. It was almost as if he'd never thought of the idea himself. 

"Do you want to give it a shot?" Vincent asked. "We'll add it to your engineering curriculum."

Xavier's jaw dropped.

Building a nanoscale manufacturing stack that didn't rely on an omniscient supercomputer was like building an Empire State Building that didn't rely on steel. Everywhere Xavier looked, the assumption of omniscience was baked in. 

"How the hell am I going to know where all the robots are?" he thought to himself. "The MHI-10 does all the coordination."

"What if you build a computer to coordinate them, inside whatever object you're manufacturing?" asked a voice in his head. "Like a computational skeleton."

Xavier was momentarily taken aback by the voice. His internal monologue had never thought in the second person before. Also, why did it have an Irish accent? Still...intriguing idea. He mulled it over.

Finally, he understood why integrated circuits had been a part of his curriculum since he was six.

Over the course of the next few months, Xavier - helped by the LLM and the voice in his head - built a new computer. It wasn't general purpose, but an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designed to design other integrated circuits. These secondary circuits were built into the structure of whatever object the ASIC was trying to construct, and their job was to coordinate the robot swarm. Every manufactured object would thus contain an embedded computer, that knew how to manufacture the rest of the object.

The ASIC was huge. It was roughly the size and shape of an oak tree. Constructed out of an unfathomably complex lattice of carbon, silicon, gold and rare earth metals, it was kept submerged in an enormous diamond tank of cooling liquid. When Xavier switched it on for the first time, it hummed. He watched the cooling liquid slowly start moving around the tank, swirling around the hundreds of thousands of delicate nanostructure leaves.

"It works!" he thought.

"It turns on," corrected the voice. "Whether it works, remains to be seen."

Slowly, he walked over to his desk and brought up his dad's Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. Praying under his breath, he drew a 1cm sphere in CAD. He then flipped over to the Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, selected a spot on his desk as the output location, and clicked "run".

He stared at the spot on his desk. For ten long seconds, nothing appeared to happen. Then, he saw a speck of dust appear. Out of it, grew a number of tiny threads, so small that he would have missed them had he not been staring so intently at that exact location. The threads grew up, branching and joining each other, until they'd built an almost invisible 1cm buckyball. The circuit.

Then, over the course of a couple seconds, the almost-invisible ball filled out. It blackened before Xavier's eyes, becoming a solid, carbon sphere. He gasped.

He picked it up. It was perfect. Impossibly light, visually flawless. He could see no trace at all of the billions of transistors integrated throughout its structure.

"Wow," he thought.

"Wow indeed," said the voice.

Just then, the door to his lab burst open and his dishevelled father ran in.

"Hey dad!" he yelled excitedly, running up to him. "It worked! Look!"

He handed the black marble to his dad, who looked down at it speechless for a few seconds.

"The ASIC made this?" Vincent asked.

"Yeah!"

Xavier's dad looked at him with a weird expression. Some mixture of pride and deep concern.

"Do you understand how dangerous this is?" he asked.

Xavier laughed and ran back to his computer. "I'm gonna make a skateboard!" he shouted.

"Not right now, you're not!" Vincent objected.

Xavier looked at his dad, confused.

"Get your jacket on and meet me at the hyperloop station in two minutes. We're going to Stacy's."

"What, now? Do I have to come?"

"Yes, you have to come."

Xavier was annoyed. "I've just made the most significant technological advance in two decades and you want me to go to a stupid dinner party?"

"You haven't been reading the news, have you?"

"No, why?"

His dad sighed. "You need to pay attention to what's going on outside your lab," he said. "There's more to life than circuits. New Sealand has gone to hell. The PR's basically bankrupt. They're pinning the blame on Russell, who's fled to Stacy's palace. Now, a colour revolution has kicked off in the TD and the PR is five minutes away from declaring war. Stacy's asked us for help. Let's go."

"Oh," responded Xavier, and paused a few seconds to process the new information.

"What are we supposed to do?" he asked.

"I don't know," his dad replied. "But when your mates ask for help, you help."

As they ran to their family's personal hyperloop station, Xavier watched his dad hurriedly mutter into his phone.

"A hundred kilos of ammo. Six railguns, fully automatic, fully charged."

The hyperloop shuttle was waiting in the station. On the floor, the railguns and ammo were materializing in front of their eyes. Once they fully solidified, Vincent smacked the button on the shuttle wall and the doors closed.

Xavier closed his eyes as the shuttle accelerated away from their homestead, to Stacy's palace in the Theocratic Dominion.
