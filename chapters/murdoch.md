## 0. Murdoch

Gabe was starting to annoy Steve a little bit by dragging practical considerations into their academic debate. "The point is moot," he said. "Leaving the planet is illegal, so calling is the only actual option."

"Okay, but just pretend it wasn't!" Steve replied. "Think of all the subtleties that can only be conveyed in person, such as...uh..."

"Such as, destroying your ship, following your trail back here to Elba, and enslaving everyone you know and love?" suggested a deep voice in a rough Irish accent.

Steve and Gabe instinctively ducked at the shock of hearing such nakedly criminal language. They turned to the source of the barbaric suggestion and saw the intruder leaning against the break room doorway. Steve recognized him immediately.

"Declan Murdoch" the man introduced himself, walking into the room and taking a seat.

Steve considered objecting to Murdoch's brazenly antisocial behaviour, but decided against it. The man was a legend - the industrial titan who had invented sustainable fusion energy. He'd parlayed that invention into incredible wealth, influence, and a lifespan of a hundred thousand years and counting. He was one of the only people alive who was born before the Great Peace.

"Has it occurred to either of you" he asked, "that announcing our presence to a star-destroying alien race may be the stupidest feckin' idea ever?"

All Steve had to offer was "Uhh."

Gabe fared little better with "can't say that it has."

"You mean to say", continued Murdoch, "that neither of you exalted professors ever thought that a civilization capable of extinguishing the most powerful objects in the universe might not want to be our friend?"

Steve avoided making eye contact with Murdoch. Truthfully, the notion that the Dysoners may not be entirely friendly had indeed flashed across his mind, but being a well socialized respectable person, he had simply ignored it. Why rock the boat?

Murdoch, it seemed, did not share that concern. He continued.

"Nice sandwich you've got there," he said, pointing at Gabe's half-eaten meatball sub. "Did you pay for it, or did you steal it?"

"I paid for it."

"Why didn't you steal it?"

Gabe gave Steve a confused look. Steve shrugged.

"Obviously because you're an ineffectual compliance artist who would chase the shopkeeper down to throw money at him if he left the shop unattended. But let's pretend you were someone else for a second. Why wouldn't you steal the sandwich?"

Gabe remained quiet. Steve also struggled with the hypothetical.

"Better yet, why don't you steal the sandwich shop? Just murder the owner, take over the shop, and start selling sandwiches for ten times the price?"

"Well," Gabe said at last, "I would think FEDSEC would have something to say about that."

Murdoch smacked the table triumphantly. "Correct! And what would FEDSEC do?"

"If I stole the sandwich, they'd probably take me in for calibration. If I did...the other thing you suggested, they'd probably...subtract me from the population."

"That's right! Now you get it. Fear of violent retribution, the key to it all. The lynchpin of collaboration! The cornerstone upon which all civilization is built!"

"What does this have to do with aliens?" Steve asked.

"It's obvious, isn't it? Do you want them to steal your sandwich?"

"What?"

Murdoch sighed and leaned in. "It's very simple. If you want to interact with someone you don't know, you must to be willing to enforce the rules of the relationship with the tools of the inquisition. If not, you'll soon find yourself and your entire civilization penniless and naked, face-down in a canal."

"_You_ are someone we don't know," Steve pointed out. "Does that mean we need to be willing to use the tools of the inquisition to keep talking?"

Murdoch grinned a little too enthusiastically. Steve looked away, slightly disconcerted.

"So," Gabe asked, "you reckon that the only way we can collaborate with the Dysoners is if we have the technology to hurt them?"

"Not just hurt them", responded Murdoch, "but to destroy them. To annihilate their civilization so thoroughly that no alien heart is left beating, no building left standing, no molecule left fused together. And even then, it won't be enough. The means are necessary but insufficient - what we really need is the will. For the threat to be credible, we need an army of merciless killers."

Steve and Gabe looked at each other, and back to Murdoch. Steve wondered how many laws Murdoch had just broken in delivering his diatribe, and hoped that no passers-by had overheard any of it. He was once again grateful for the loud StevieNix cooling fans.

"So you came to...us?"

Murdoch sighed. "Yes, but don't worry. I'm under no illusions that you have what it takes. I bet there's less than a thousand people on this entire planet with the balls to threaten an alien race. FEDSEC's done such a great job of pruning out aggression. Ambition. Unhinged lunacy. You're all so boring."

"Why us, then?"

Murdoch glanced briefly at the rat's nest of donated servers humming in the corner, before facing Steve. "You're the StevieNix guy, right? You wrote _Sexual Reproduction - A Meta-Meta Heuristic Algorithm for Genetic Optimization_?"

Steve nodded.

Murdoch smiled and handed Steve a letter. "Then you're the guy I'm looking for. Can I interest you in working for Murdoch Heavy Industries? We're gonna make an AI."
