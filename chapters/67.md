# 67. Collateral Damage

"You can't just keep disappearing people," Sullivan cautioned her. "One more mysterious retirement and someone's going to be thumbtacking photos to the wall and stringing yarn back to a picture of your face."

Stacy II sighed. She'd already been looking forward to giving her new boss the 'death or tranpsortation' treatment. "This innocent face?" she asked, batting her eyelashes at Sullivan.

"There needs to be a story," Sullivan replied, ignoring her. "One that explains all these people leaving their posts."

"Plague?"

"Not targeted enough."

"Syphilis?"

Sullivan glared at the smirking young lady. "This is serious. You had Filbert build a domestic terror squad, remember? What did you think that was for? Kidnapping, catfishing and joking around?"

Stacy II's face fell. She'd been trying to avoid this line of thinking.

"Grow up," Sullivan snapped harshly. "You want to manipulate the levers of power? Subvert a political system and install yourself as dictator? It's time you came to grips with the volume of blood that needs to spill to make that happen."

She wiped her sweaty palms on the hem of her bright red dress as she sat and stared at the enormous stone pillars of the casino. The timer was already set, she told herself. One minute and fourteen seconds to go, and there was nothing she could do about it.

"You didn't seem to mind so much when it was New Australians," her mom's voice appeared in her head.

"That was different!" she retorted. "They were basically savages. These people are..."

"Like you?"

Stacy II sighed. "Yeah," she thought. "They're like me."

"Then they'll understand," the elder Stacy replied. "It's not personal, sweetie. It's just politics."

Stacy II chewed a fingernail. She was starting to dislike politics.

She looked around the lavishly decorated casino floor, which had been rented out entirely for the Department of Health's monthly Leadership Summit. Having studied the department's org chart for months, she recognized most of the faces in the room. She maintained a perfect deadpan expression as she watched them drunkenly stumble around the floor, playing grab-ass and pissing away their taxpayer-funded per diems at the roulette wheel.

Then, her eyes flicked to the dealers behind the tables, the servers carrying trays of canap√©s, the security guards watching over the blackjack tables. It was relatively easy to suppress her concern for the lives of the government employees. But the collateral damage? That was a tougher pill to swallow.

"Don't you have to go?" her mom asked.

Stacy II checked her phone. Nineteen seconds left.

When the countdown hit eleven seconds, she got up from her chair and started walking towards the pillar.

"Slow down," her mom cautioned. "You're power-walking."

Stacy II swore silently under her breath. She had lost track of the number of times she'd practiced this walk. She had trained and trained, until it was repeatable down to the hundredth of a second. And now, with her heart pumping and adrenals on full throttle, she was all over the place.

"Three," she counted internally as she approached the pillar.

"Two," she recited, her mom joining her.

"One."

The fiery blast ripped the crowded casino floor to shreds as she crossed behind the shelter of the stone pillar.

"Too jacked," Annabel said, shaking her head at the screen. "Less 80s action figure, more basement nerd. And lean harder into the terrorist aesthetic."

Filbert deleted his prompt and tried again, typing `scrawny nerd balaclava ak47 anarchist flag` into the text field and clicking "generate". An image appeared of a slender man in a balaclava, toting an ak-47 in front of an an anarchist flag.

"That's it!" Annabel said, approvingly. "That's our guy! Save it!"

Filbert saved the generated image to his hard drive and flipped over to the video generator.

As they waited for the video to generate, he tried making small talk.

"Do you feel bad about the people we killed?" he asked.

"Huh?" she responded. "We didn't kill any people."

Filbert looked at her, confused.

"Only government employees," she smirked.

"What about the casino staff?"

Annabel shrugged. "Conspirators in a criminal enterprise. Don't want to get blown up? Don't accept blood money."

Filbert nodded, satisfied that his subordinate had fewer ethical qualms about their actions than he did. As it should be.

The video finished rendering, and they clicked 'play'. A high definition video played of the balaclava-nerd speaking into the camera. In less than a minute, their avatar claimed responsibility for the attack, blamed the Commonwealth for bringing it upon themselves, and vowed further violence if they didn't immediately retreat from the islands formerly known as The Anarchy.

"Pretty good," Annabel remarked, "but way too HD. Jack up the contrast and run it through an early 2000s potato-cam filter."

Filbert jacked up the contrast and started looking for such a filter.

The photo of Stacy II in her bright red dress, surrounded by dust and pulling a survivor from the rubble, was shared over a hundred thousand times on social media. "Dress lady" became not just the image associated with the event, but an icon of bravery, heroism, and the selfless devotion to the public that the Commonwealth Government so tirelessly worked to achieve.

Stacy II was so overwhelmed with interview requests that she had to stop answering her phone.

"I was in such shock," she recalled to one interviewer, "that I didn't have time to think. I just followed my instincts, you know? And I saw this poor man - I think he was a waiter - trapped under a beam, and I just..."

She paused to stifle a sob.

"Oh darling," the interviewer cooed, handing her a box of tissues. "Take all the time you need. You are so brave. So, so, brave."

Stacy II sniffed.
