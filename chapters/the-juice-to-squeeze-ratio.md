## 0. The Juice-to-Squeeze Ratio

This time, no one came to meet Stacy II outside the Anarcho-Cannibalist village. The clearing outside of the village was deserted and the gate in the wooden fence was open, so she just walked in.

Her first reaction upon entering was to disbelieve her eyes. She was starving, dehydrated, freezing and exhausted. Perhaps the physical punishment of her long, ill-prepared trudge across the island had finally broken her mind and caused her to hallucinate.

There were women and children everywhere. A group of twenty or so kids were running around and squealing with joy, playing soccer. She half-suspected the ball to be a human head, but it was a genuine, fully-inflated soccer ball. Looking around, she counted as many women as men, a phenomenon she hadn't experienced since leaving the Theocratic Dominion months ago. She wondered if there were more women in this village than the rest of New Australia put together.

She walked up to a group of couples who were enjoying a picnic of cheese, charcuterie, and wine. With a wary eye to the ham and salami, she opened her mouth to speak.

"Excuse me," she asked. "Is this the Anarcho-Cannibalist village?"

The happily chattering couples froze and glared at her with suspicion. One of the men stood up. "Who's asking?" he demanded.

"My name is Stacy the Second," she replied.

Another man piped up. "You're that crazy lady who showed up months ago, claiming to be queen!" he exclaimed. "I thought we sent you packing! Looks like you need a reminder," he remarked, standing up and advancing towards Stacy II.

The first man put up his hand to halt the advance of the second. "We can't kick her out," he objected. "She's seen inside now."

The second man nodded. "So now what?" he asked.

"Take her to Curtis," suggested one of the women. "He'll know what to do."

The men seized Stacy II's arms. "Sounds good," replied the first.

"Don't eat all the salami while we're gone," said the second.

******

Curtis appeared to be in his late sixties or early seventies, wore glasses, and kept his long hair in a ponytail. He was soft-spoken and regarded Stacy II with kind eyes and a gentle smile. "Stacy Two, in the flesh," he said as they entered his house. "Thank you gentlemen, you can leave her here," he said to the two men who had dragged her in.

They released her arms and left, presumably to return to the picnic before the salami ran out. Stacy II looked around her environment with curiosity. Like the huts on the rest of the island, the house was constructed from wood - but that was where the similarities ended. Instead of roughly hacked logs and sticks, the wood had been milled and sanded into smooth boards. The floor, instead of the dirt she had become accustomed to, was made of polished hardwood planks. A blazing fire was roaring in a cast iron stove in one corner of the room, and the ceiling was lit with electric lights.

She gravitated to the fireplace, attracted by the heat.

"Would you like a cup of tea?" Curtis asked.

Stacy II nodded wordlessly. She hadn't had a cup of tea in months.

As Curtis filled a stainless steel kettle from a tap and the warmth from the fire began to thaw her bones, she found her voice. "Where did you get all this stuff?" she asked.

Curtis laughed. "Oh, here and there," he replied, non-specifically. Then, catching her confused look, he clarified. "It's mostly smuggled in from overseas."

"You have access to overseas markets? Why don't you escape, then?"

"Why would we?"

Stacy II pondered the question, realized she couldn't answer it, and moved on. "Why are there so many women here?"

"They're mostly smuggled in from overseas as well."

"Why on earth would they come here?"

Curtis placed the kettle on the stove. "You sure do ask a lot of questions, Stacy II. How about you start by explaining why you're here? Then we can get to your questions, I promise."

"I needed somewhere to stay," she responded simply. "With people I hadn't pissed off," she added.

The old man nodded. "You've discovered the second edge of the sword of explicit rule," he remarked.

"The sword of explicit rule?" she asked.

"Authoritarianism. The iron fist. A crude, unsophisticated tactic. Useful in emergencies, but statistically likely to result in your untimely death. I rarely recommend it." He lowered his glasses and peered over them at Stacy II. "Your mother favoured it," he added. "My condolences, by the way."

"You knew my mom?" Stacy II asked.

Curtis smiled. "I knew her well. I was her closest advisor. I remember you being born."

"So why are you here?"

A sadness overtook Curtis's face. "The higher you climb, the harder you fall," he replied vaguely.

Stacy II cocked her head and stayed silent, so Curtis continued.

"Do you remember the Vegan Rebellion?"

"No," Stacy II responded truthfully. She had been very young at the time, but had heard stories.

"It was mostly about fertilizer. It looked like they were going to win, so I prematurely switched sides. In recognition of my previous years of loyal service, your mom let me keep my head attached to my body. I've been here ever since."

Stacy II was disgusted. Not only was the man across from her a cannibal, but he had double-crossed her mother. "So after trying to back a vegan rebellion against my mom, you decided to found a community of cannibals?"

Curtis laughed. "It's a bit more complicated than that," he said.

The kettle began to whistle and the old man hobbled back to the stove. "Earl Grey?" he asked.

"Whatever," Stacy II responded. "Tell me about the cannibalism," she demanded.

He picked a couple of teabags out of a box of Earl Grey and placed them into mugs. "We didn't start out this way," he explained. "My first attempt was Anarcho-Communism. We shared everything. Food, houses, chores. Got to maybe twenty people before it fell apart."

"What happened?"

"No one wanted to clean the stables. I had to do it myself. Same with digging toilets, or butchering. Basically anything that wasn't fun, if I didn't do it myself, it wouldn't get done. That's when I tried a little explicit rule of my own," he smiled as he poured boiling water into the mugs.

"You tried to explicitly rule an Anarchist commune?"

"Yeah, they didn't take well to it. Most people don't. Turns out, if you want to rule, you need to be subtle about it. Better if people don't realize they're ruled at all. I was lucky to survive."

"So then what?"

"The commune fell apart. A couple of the guys and I tried to start again, with Anarcho-Capitalism this time. Everything privately owned."

"Everything?"

Curtis nodded. "Everything. You wanted stable space, you rented it from the stable owner. You want to take a dump, you either dig your own toilet or rent it from the toilet guy. This actually worked really well for a while. We grew to over a hundred people."

He bobbed one of the teabags up and down by its string, and, satisfied with the colour of the tea, removed the teabag and extracted a bottle of milk from a small bar fridge under the counter. "Milk?" he asked.

"Yes please. What happened to the An-Cap project?"

Curtis carefully poured a small amount of milk into the mug and continued his story. "Raids. Especially from the House of Lords. It's hard to pretend you're an Anarcho-Capitalist collective when you have to pay taxes to the mob. We tried to defend ourselves, but..."

"But?"

Curtis sighed. "No one could force the guys to fight. Someone set up a sort of defence insurance company. The idea was, people would pay the insurance company, and if a raid happened, the company would defend them. The thing is, have you ever dealt with an insurance company? Every time the raiders showed up, the company would try to wriggle out of cover. Especially raids by the House of Lords - the company called those a 'guaranteed event'. So people stopped paying their premiums, the company went bankrupt, and we got flattened."

He handed the mug of tea to Stacy II. She accepted it, sipped it gratefully, and sighed as the hot liquid radiated heat out from her cold, empty stomach. It was the most delicious thing she'd consumed in her entire life. After the rush of dopamine subsided sufficiently for her to open her eyes again, she prompted Curtis to continue his story. "So then, Anarcho-Cannibalism?"

Curtis nodded. "The raiders are tyrants. Tyrants are simple. Their brains are set up to only evaluate one question."

"And that is?"

"'Is the juice worth the squeeze?'"

Stacy II laughed. She'd asked herself that very question countless times over the past few months. "So you changed your juice-to-squeeze ratio?"

"Yep. Particularly the squeeze. It's the first benefit of Anarcho-Cannibalism. The squeeze is, if you try to raid us, you might be cooked alive and eaten. Most people find that far worse than simply being killed."

"And the juice?"

"Well..." he gestured around the comfortable, warm, well-furnished house. "As you can see, there's quite a lot of juice. It might even be worth the squeeze, to be honest, so we have to keep it secret. That's why, I'm sorry to say, no one who walks through those gates gets to leave. Not until they've been inducted."

"Inducted?" Stacy II asked, nervously.

Curtis smiled. "The second benefit of Anarcho-Cannibalism," he replied. "Total dedication to the project. I don't have to dig the toilets, or force anyone to fight. Anarcho-Cannibalists will never defect, never slack off, never do anything that would sabotage the community. Why? No one out there wants anything to do with any of us. Everyone here would be a pariah out there. Once you go An-Can, you never go back."

Stacy II put down her mug. "I'm still not following. What exactly do you mean, 'inducted'?"

"It's very simple." The old man's tone was suddenly meaner, almost menacing. "The moment you walked in through that gate, Stacy II, you damned yourself to become part of us - one way or another. It's eat or be eaten, your Royal Highness. That's the way of the world. We've just laid it out clearer than most."
