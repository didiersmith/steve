## 0. The Island

Ants. There were ants crawling all over his skin.

Russell awoke with a yelp and shook them off.

"Good morning, sunshine!" called out Vincent. "We thought you'd never wake up!"

Russell spun around. Vincent and Stacy were already up. Stacy had already changed her outfit.

The campfire had disappeared. It was no longer required - the blazing overhead sun was threatening him with the opposite problem. His throat was parched and his ordinarily never-leaves-the-house-white skin felt like it was being roasted over a coal fire.

"Do we have any water?" he asked.

"Up there," Vincent pointed.

Russell turned towards the center of the island. Where the black carbon cylinder had previously stood, was a hill. A light, brown hill. He blinked. The whole island seemed to be turning brown as he watched.

Looking down, he saw ants. Wait - no, not ants. Robots. Hundreds - no, millions - of tiny robot ants, scurrying to and from the hill, carrying...dirt.

The ants were terraforming the island.

"Didn't like the look of the poly...the poly...?"

"The polymerized fullerene?" Vincent asked. "It's a solid foundation, but good luck growing anything on it."

Russell started walking up the hill. His burned, salt-covered skin cracked as he moved. Damn, it was hot. They needed shade. 

Before long, he spotted the water source - a tiny stream, flowing through a crease in the fullerene. He dropped to his knees and drank greedily. The cool water soothed his parched throat. When he was done, he washed his face and arms in the stream. Gosh, that felt better.

"Hey Stacy!" he yelled. "Does this water have any weird chemicals in it?"

She and Vincent laughed.

When Russell was done, he climbed to the top of the hill to get a better look. The higher he climbed, the darker the ground got underneath his feet and the more it felt like real earth.

He reached the top and surveyed the island. So, this was it. Vincent's masterpiece. Their societal canvas. The place where belief would be reignited, poverty would be extinguished, and...why was it a hexagon?

He trudged back down to the others. Stacy had cleaned herself up, changed her outfit again, and evidently given Vincent her phone and roped him into being her photographer.

"Why is it a hexagon?" he asked.

"Hexagon is the bestagon," Vincent said.

Okay, whatever. He could work with a hexagon. "Are we floating?"

"Sort of!" Vincent replied, putting Stacy's phone in his pocket so he could use both hands to gesticulate."We're anchored to the supply chain, which is anchored to the crust. That's why we had to come out all the way here - it's an amphidromic point."

"An amphi..."

"There are no tides."

"Ah. Will we sink?"

Vincent shook his head. "The fullerene is super light. Assuming it holds together, it'll never get waterlogged."

"Assuming it holds together?"

"Don't worry about it."

Russell couldn't help but worry about it a little bit.

"Excuse me nerds," interrupted Stacy, "but some of us have work to do here."

Russell looked over at her. "Work?" he asked, pointing his chin in the general direction of her white sundress.

"Yes," she said. "The actual hard part. This island is neat and all, but the world is full of islands that no one wants to live on. What makes you think this one is going to be any different?"

Moving to this one will give you free money, Russell thought.

"She's been documenting all our progress on social media," Vincent explained, taking the phone back out of his pocket and lining up a shot. "She has like ten million followers."

Oh, great. Russell could have kicked himself. While he had been writing his app, the pretty little autocrat had been getting a head start.

"You got ten million followers in a few months?" Russell asked.

"I already had one million. I was a faith influencer."

"What's a faith influencer?"

Stacy ignored him and resumed her pose. Once Vincent finally managed a photo that met her standards, she took her phone back, spoke into it, and was swarmed by robots. When they cleared, her clothing had been transformed into a red bikini top and matching skirt.

Russell bristled a litle. Seemed like an abuse of the LLM.

"Can we get some sort of tropical pergola here?" she asked her phone. "Think Bali, tiki bar sorta vibes."

Russell couldn't help himself. "Pious nun goes clubbing in Ibiza sorta vibes?"

Stacy glared at him as a bamboo pergola grew out of the ground in front of them. When it was done, she climbed up onto a barstool and picked up the fruity cocktail that the nano-robots had assembled on the bar.

"I wouldn't drink that," warned Vincent. "The robots are designed for making computers and structural carbon. Drinks that don't kill you are outside of the spec."

Stacy looked suspiciously at the drink. Suppressing her obvious disgust, she held it up next to her face and beamed a smile that would have halted a Mongol invasion. After Vincent had taken several photos, she relaxed her expression, placed the glass gingerly back on the bar and stepped away. "We're going to have to figure out how to make real drinks before the people start arriving," she said.

Vincent and Russell nodded.

"Maybe they can bring their own drinks," Vincent suggested.

Russell's skin was starting to burn again. He took Stacy's place at the bar in the welcome shade of the pergola. Gosh, it was nice. 

His throat was still parched. Absent-mindedly, he reached out for Stacy's fruity cocktail and took a sip.

Mmm. Watermelon.
