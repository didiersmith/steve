## 0. The Manufacturing Singularity

The next day was even more ambitious. The ape had fully automated manufacturing - now, time to make it nanoscale.

"Make smaller robots," Murdoch said into his microphone. "Use the robot to make smaller robots."

Vincent's internal monologue played out over his speakers and ran with the seeded thought.

"I should make smaller robots," Vincent thought. "Then I can use those robots to make even smaller robots. How small can I go?"

"Really small," Murdoch suggested.

"I bet I can make them really small," Vincent thought.

Murdoch sat back and chuckled. This would never cease to be satisfying.

People had been predicting an imminent manufacting singularity on Elba for as long as Murdoch could remember. Each generation of tech would build on the previous, accelerating faster and faster until everything, everywhere was robots...It had never materialized.

Manufacturing had been in stasis for millenia. Pretty much everything was. Just the way FEDSEC liked it. The only truly new technology was the MHI-10, and he'd damn near bankrupted Murdoch Heavy Industries to build it.

Fortunately, with the help of a motivated God and a superintelligent chatbot, the apes in StevieNix could achieve what the people of Elba could not.

"You need a power source," Murdoch said. "Try graphene supercapacitors."

"Lithium batteries aren't going to cut it," thought Vincent. "I should make supercapacitors. Maybe graphene."

Shaking his head and smiling, Murdoch clicked around in the incomprehensible window looking for the "breakpoint" button. Steve had clicked...there. And then the speed slider...

A few moments later, the sim paused. Vincent's hair was a couple inches longer and the robot spider was collecting dust on his shelf. He was surrounded by a new generation of robots. Murdoch zoomed in. They were three orders of magnitude smaller.

How curious. Murdoch panned the window around, studying Vincent's inventions. They were lightweight - approximately 40 grams each - and looked like ants, each the size of an ape's finger.

He dragged the speed slider back down to real-time, and unpaused. What a show! The ants swarmed all over the garage, each performing specialized operations. There were cutter ants, who broke apart materials, transportation ants, welding ants, laser ants...

Goodness, the ape had been busy.

Murdoch leaned into the microphone. "Make them smaller," he said.

"I should make them smaller," Vincent thought.

As the robots got smaller and smaller, Vincent required more and more hands-on assistance. The next generation needed custom semiconductors. Then, they needed exotic rare earth metals. Murdoch prompted Vincent to design robotic mining worms, and dump billions of them into his backyard.

The ground under the city of Perth was filled with an intricate network of tunnels just a few millimeters in diameter. It was a real sight to behold. Whatever section of dirt Murdoch randomly chose, if he zoomed in close enough, he could find a mining robot, searching for elemental deposits and shunting them back to the garage.

"Smaller," he said.

"Smaller," Vincent thought.

Breakpoint, fast-forward, guidance. Breakpoint, fast-forward, guidance. Murdoch settled into a rhythm. The next shrink created robots the size of yeast. Then, bacteria. Then, viruses. The smaller the robots, the more fun they were - until suddenly, things started getting weird. At the atomic level, the particles got crazy.

Murdoch hauled Steve into his office to berate him.

"Why are the electrons jumping around?" he demanded.

"They aren't in a fixed position. Too computationally expensive. There's just a probability distribution of their locations and we evaluate that just in time."

"Speak English, Steve! How the feck do I stick the fecking atoms together? I've burned like two days on this!"

Steve blushed. "Just stick to carbon. Carbon's easy."

Murdoch grumbled and unmuted the mic.

"Stick to carbon," he relayed.

Vincent stuck to carbon.

Eventually, they got it to work. The final shrink consisted of highly specialized molecular machines - they could hardly be called robots - which swarmed like a living liquid, placing and bonding individual atoms wherever they needed to be. Vincent created all sorts of fantastic devices - miniature airships, railguns, even a fusion-powered motorcycle.

Anything is possible when you can put atoms wherever you want them.

And then, that was it. No more shrinks. Fully automated nanoscale manufacturing, finished in a week. Easy peasy.

Now, onto the hard part - the interstellar warship. Probably needed more Vincents for that.

What to do, what to do...
