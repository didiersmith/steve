## 0. The Manufacturing Singularity

"Make smaller robots," Murdoch said into the ape's head. "Use the robot to make smaller robots."

He listened as Vincent's internal monologue took over and ran with the seeded thought.

"Smaller robots," he thought. "Then I can use those robots to make even smaller robots. How small can I go?"

"Really small," Murdoch suggested.

"I bet I can make them really small," Vincent thought.

Murdoch sat back and chuckled. This would never cease to be satisfying.

Terrestrial commentators had long speculated on how the manufacturing singularity would play out. They had always imagined the progress to follow something like Moore's Law - a wickedly fast progression in the long arc of human history, but a banal plod in the lifetimes of the people fortunate enough to see it happen.

Of course, none had factored in the assistance of a motivated God and a superintelligent omniscient chatbot.

Between the combined efforts of Murdoch, Vincent, the LLM and the robots, each next step in the progression was realized almost as quickly as they could imagine it.

They needed a portable power source - lithium batteries fell far short of the capacity needed to mill, weld, and sinter on the go. Plumbing the depths of the LLM's brain, Murdoch and Vincent invented a method of producing high quality graphene in Vincent's two-car garage. Within an hour, the robot was mass producing graphene supercapacitors.

The next generation of robots was three orders of magnitude smaller - while the spider weighed 40kg, its offspring weighed only 40 grams. They were modelled after ants, with six limbs and bodies the length of a human finger. Instead of being able to do a wide array of things, like the spider, each ant was specialized to perform only one or two tasks.

Working together, the God/ape pair created cutter ants who carefully broke apart materials, transportation ants who could carry up to 40 times their bodyweight, welding ants, laser ants, carbon fiber synthesis ants, and many more. Each ant was powered by an array of supercapacitors and communicated to a base station via a salvaged bluetooth chip. The ants covered the entire workshop, moving in a coordinated swarm. When an ant ran low on power, it would run over to the charging station and swap out its supercapacitors, while another ant took its place. There were ants everywhere.

Then, they shrank the robots again.

For this shrink, microchip size became the major limiting factor - the salvage chips they'd been relying on up to this point were simply too big. Murdoch, Vincent and the LLM spent some time developing ants capable of performing the deposition, lithography and micromachining necessary to manufacture semiconductors. The resultant generation of robots were controlled by tiny, silicon brains containing the absolute minimum number of transistors necessary to perform their assigned tasks. The average robot weighed 8 milligrams, and its size was that of an actual ant. 

The 8 milligram robots took on many shapes. Swarms of tiny, fruit fly-inspired robots buzzed around the workshop, transporting parts for the other bugs to cut and refashion into more robots. Now that the process had been freed from reliance on salvage electronics, they turned to raw materials instead of upcycling junk. The team designed robotic mining worms, tasked them with finding rare earth metals, and released billions of them into Vincent and Russell's backyard.

Unbeknownst to anyone, the ground under the city of Perth was filled with an intricate network of tunnels just a few millimeters in diameter. The tunnel network was composed of billions of perfectly spherical hubs, connected by trillions of perfectly straight spokes, efficiently routing robotic worms and optical communication from high-density elemental deposits under the city to the manufacturing hub in the garage.

The next shrink created robots the size of yeast. At this scale, Murdoch had to zoom way in to see the robots and Vincent couldn't see them at all. The pair had fun with the yeast robots, using them to create exotic materials - sheets of heavenly silk, columns of marble, or intricate braids of gold and transistors. But mostly, they used the yeast-bots to manifest the final shrink.

The final shink was very, very hard. Murdoch hauled Steve into his office to berate him.

"Why are the electrons jumping around?" he demanded.

"They aren't in a fixed position," Steve attempted to explain. "Too computationally expensive. There's just a probability distribution of their locations and we evaluate that just in time."

"What the hell does that even mean? How am I supposed to stick atoms together without even knowing where the particles are?"

"It works, I swear!"

Murdoch grumbled, turned away, and continued muttering suggestions into Vincent's head.

Eventually they got it to work. Mostly with carbon atoms.

The final shrink consisted of highly specialized molecular machines - they could hardly be called robots - that operated at the atomic scale. Each machine's bizarre structure was uniquely suited to its assigned task, which was to place and bond atoms in desired locations.

Once the final shrink had been achieved, truly fantastic structures appeared on command. Impossibly light airships and gliders flew around the ceiling of the garage. Railguns of various shapes and sizes materialized on the workbench. Murdoch even helped Vincent design a tiny fusion reactor.

After that, Murdoch took a step back and let Vincent have fun for a while. Vincent took the opportunity to create a fusion-powered motorcycle. He took for a 350km/h joyride down Tonkin Highway at 1am and returned to the house, shaking.

"I think my blood is eighty percent adrenaline," he announced, striding into the kitchen.

Russell and Stacy were still up, nursing mugs of tea. In the past few weeks, Stacy had become their de facto third roommate. She had taken over Vincent's room while he slept in a hammock in the garage.

Stacy ran up to him and threw her arms around his neck. "You idiot! How fast did you get?"

"I hit three fifty. Not fast enough for Bonneville, but definitely fast enough for Tonkin Highway."

Russell burst into laughter, while Stacy scowled and returned to her mug of tea.

"I definitely feel ready to increase the fertility rate now, if you know what I mean!" Vincent remarked.

"Go to hell!" came the response. Vincent joined Russell in laughter. Eventually, Stacy couldn't help but laugh too.

"What was it like?" asked Russell.

"Windy. The air kept trying to pull me off. It was all I could do to hang on."

Stacy shook her head. "Such an unbelievable idiot", she chuckled.

Vincent made himself a cup of tea, and the trio spent the next hour reminiscing over the past few weeks. Finally, when all their mugs were empty, Russell asked the big question.

"Are we ready to go?"

"Let's do it!" Vincent responded.

Stacy just nodded and put down her mug. Russell pulled a box off the bookshelf and pulled out a Starlink transceiver.

The three put on the warmest jackets they owned and walked down to the Swan River.

Murdoch stubbed out his cigarette and stroked his chin. Now for the fun part.
