## 0. StevieNix

Steve's universe was the joke of the Computer Science department. The physics were janky, the simulated beings were obsessed with reproduction, and Steve's inability to land a decent grant meant that the entire world ran on a heap of donated hardware in the corner of the break room. He called it StevieNix, and it was his pride and joy.

He didn't mind the jokes. In fact, he couldn't. Any part of his psyche that might get upset at being called a "doddering fool" or "space-brained eccentric" had been either corrected under the gentle guidance of the Federal Department of Social Emotional Calibration (FEDSEC), or sliced out of his genome before he was born. To take offense was to take the first step on the path of aggression - a path that led inevitably to being clipped out of the perfect tapestry that was his happy, peaceful society.

Steve, like everyone around him, was content. He couldn't risk to be otherwise. He would gladly have spent the next thousand years in the CS department break room, alternating between exploring StevieNix in VR and engaging in academic debate with his best and only friend Gabe. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.

One day, for whatever reason, Sirius disappeared from the night sky. This changed Steve's life forever.

"How do you know it's aliens?" Steve asked, leaning forwards on the table and cradling his mug of instant coffee. "It could be anything."

"It couldn't be anything," Gabe objected. "There's no natural phenomenon that can cause a star to just vanish. You get like, a billion years' heads up."

Gabe was a professor of astronomy.

"There's no natural phenomenon - that you know about! Maybe it happens all the time and you've just missed it."

"We have records of the night sky going back a hundred thousand years, Steve."

"And you've never seen a star disappear before?"

Gabe looked around. As usual, he and Steve were the only ones in the break room - the constant hum of StevieNix's cooling fans was enough to drive away anyone else who might be drawn to the ostensibly communal area.

"Truth be told," Gabe admitted, "we have. Sirius is just the first one to capture public attention. The horoscope guys have been making a big deal about it."

Steve cocked his head.

"This is the seventeenth star to disappear in the past few millenia," Gabe continued. "There's a little burst of discussion in the astronomy journals every time, and then it quiets down. No one knows why it's happening."

"So therefore, it's aliens?"

"Yeah. Aliens building Dyson spheres. It's the only thing that makes sense."

Steve wasn't convinced that an alien race enveloping stars in giant spheres made more sense than his theory - that the astronomy community had an incomplete understanding of the universe. In the interest of social harmony, however, he held his tongue and granted Gabe the benefit of the doubt.

"So what do you propose we do?" he asked.

Gabe nodded. "To call, or to knock?" he asked. "The great debate. It comes up every time. I'm a caller, myself."

There were few things Steve enjoyed more than a spirited, yet pointless academic debate. He immediately adopted the opposing viewpoint and launched into a passionate spiel about how it would be much better to construct an interstellar spacecraft and go visit the aliens in person ("knock") than to just contact them over radio ("call").

The two professors became so engrossed in their discussion that they failed to notice when the break room door opened and a third figure slipped into the room.
