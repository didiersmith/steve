"A pivotal change is about to take place in your life," Steve announced to Gabe, plopping the horoscope section of the Elba Daily on the break room table in front of him. "Loyalties will be tested."

Gabe laughed and pushed the newspaper back towards Steve without reading it. "Are they still stuck on the Sirius thing?"

Steve nodded and rotated the sheet back towards himself. "The continued darkening of Sirius portends..."

"What's yours?"

Steve scanned the section, looking for Cancer.

"Looks like I'm due for a bit of...ooh, significant transformation. Something about a crossroads. 'As Sirius continues to recede in luminance...'"

Gabe grabbed the newspaper out of his hands and threw it in the bin. "These idiots need new material," he said. "The Sirius thing is played out."

"Hey, at least they've got answers. Better than the astronomy community."

Gabe turned slightly red. "We do have answers," he objected.

"What, aliens?" Steve laughed.

"Yes."

"Little green men are eating a star?"

"Little green men are building a Dyson sphere."

"Doesn't seem very scientific to me."

"It's more scientific than that!" Gabe objected, pointing to the bin.

"There's gotta be a natural explanation."

Gabe shook his head. "There isn't. There's no natural phenomenon that can cause a star to just vanish. You get like, a billion years' heads up."

"As far as you know! Maybe it happens all the time and you've just missed it."

"We have records of the night sky going back a hundred thousand years, Steve."

"And you've never seen a star disappear before?"

Gabe scanned the room. He looked uncomfortable, but didn't need to be. As usual, the two of them were the only ones in the Computer Science department break room - the constant hum of StevieNix's cooling fans drove away everyone else from the ostensibly communal area.

"Truth be told," Gabe admitted under his voice, "we have. Sirius is just the first one to capture public attention."

Steve cocked his head.

"This is the seventeenth star to disappear in the past few millennia," Gabe continued. "There's a little burst of discussion in the astronomy journals every time, and then it quiets down. No one knows why it's happening."

"So therefore, it's aliens?"

"Yeah." Gabe leaned back and his voice resumed its ordinary volume. "Aliens building Dyson spheres. It's the only thing that makes sense."

Steve wasn't convinced that an alien race enveloping stars in giant spheres made more sense than his theory - that the astronomy community had an incomplete understanding of the universe. In the interest of social harmony, however, he held his tongue and granted Gabe the benefit of the doubt. He had to get back to work.

With an exaggerated eyeroll at his best and only friend, Steve donned his VR headset and jacked into StevieNix.

Damn. The giant reptiles were still around. They'd completely taken over his simulated universe.

Steve chewed his fingernails. This wasn't ideal. Grant money was hard enough to come by, and usually flowed to the more "realistic" sims - the ones populated by 'people', or at least, marginally intelligent beings with thumbs. Lizards the size of buildings? Good luck securing funding for that.

At this rate, StevieNix was doomed to run on a heap of donated hardware in the corner of the break room forever. Not that Steve minded, of course. He didn't mind anything. Not his budget constraints, not the janky physics necessitated by the low-powered hardware, and certainly not the jokes from the rest of the CS department. In fact, it wasn't just that he didn't mind - he actually couldn't.

Any part of Steve's psyche that might get upset at being called a "doddering fool" or "air-headed eccentric" had been either corrected under the gentle guidance of the Federal Department of Social Emotional Calibration (FEDSEC), or sliced out of his genome before he was born. To take offense was to take the first step on the path of aggression - a path that led inevitably to being clipped out of the perfect tapestry that was his happy, peaceful society.

Steve, like everyone around him, was content. He couldn't risk to be otherwise.

Gently humming to himself, he pondered various options for solving his giant reptile problem. Radiation, perhaps? Or maybe some sort of plague? Tricky...Maybe Gabe had some ideas.

He jacked out.

Gabe didn't have any ideas. He'd fished the newspaper out of the bin and was still going on about the aliens.

"Bloody knockers," he grumbled, scowling at an opinion column.

"Huh?" Steve asked.

Gabe pushed the paper over, got up and stretched. "Fools who think we should make first contact in person," he explained, walking over to the coffee machine. "You know. Build an interstellar spaceship and fly to Sirius. Knock on their door."

"What's wrong with that?" Steve asked.

Gabe gave him a confused look as he filled his mug. "Aside from being illegal," he said, "it's stupid. Obviously, first contact should be made remotely. Calling is more polite than knocking."

Steve nodded. He'd forgotten about that archaic law. People were banned from leaving the planet, but so what? It was like banning people from breathing underwater. Tabling his reptile problem for now, he launched wholeheartedly into his favourite pastime - pointless academic debate.

"I think knocking is a great idea," he said.

The two professors became so engrossed in their discussion that they failed to notice when the break room door opened, and a third figure slipped into the room.
