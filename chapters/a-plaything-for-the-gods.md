## 0. A Plaything for the Gods

When Steve received the design brief, it was even worse than he'd thought. Not only was he supposed to read their minds, but he had to influence them as well! He strode around his office, fuming. Gabe, who had composed himself since the previous conversation, sat on the couch and lent a sympathetic ear.

"Changing requirements!" Steve cried. "Every goddamn time! Why can't people just figure out what they want and ask for it up front? Why do they have to ask for one thing, then ask for something completely different once that first thing is delivered?"

"Oh, I know", agreed Gabe, who didn't really (no one ever asked him for anything).

"These minds are insanely complicated! We're talking billions of parallel matrix operations, all bathed in a sea of hormones! It's a miracle that it does anything! How's anyone supposed to understand it?"

"I guess he just thinks really highly of you", Gabe offered, consolingly.

Steve slumped into his chair. "It's just impossible. Six months' work, down the drain. I'm going to have to start again from scratch, with this stupid requirement baked into the universe somehow."

"Surely not! There must be some way to hack it in! So the problem is that the thought space is too big, right?"

"Yes. Way, way, way too big."

As an astronomer, Gabe had some familiarity with big things - for instance, the space of potential research questions was endless, but the space of research questions that would attract grant funding was substantially smaller.

"Can you focus on just one part of the brain?"

"They think with their whole brains, Gabe. And their bodies too."

"What if they didn't?"

"Huh?"

"What if you forced all their thoughts through a bottleneck, and just figured out how to understand and manipulate that bottleneck?"

Steve's initial reaction was "they would be profoundly mentally impacted", but realized that there was a candidate bottleneck - the language center.

Mapping the language center was relatively straightforward. He picked a subpopulation and recorded their neural activation levels and hormonal breakdown every time they spoke. Over time, he built a huge corpus of brain activity and associated language. Then, he trained a simple classifier to map the brain activity when the ape was speaking to the words that came out of his or her mouth. Because each ape's brain structure was slightly different, he had to train a fairly coarse foundation model, and fine-tune it on each ape.

The result was a program that allowed him to hear the words they spoke without actually listening to the sounds, but by watching their brain activity. A neat party trick, but he'd been told to read their minds, not their spoken words.

He started running his brain/speech classifier on the apes' brains while they were not talking. Every time he tried, the results were garbage. Again and again, for months, he listened to garbage. He increased cosmic radiation to try to get more mutations, but instead of new neural patterns he mostly got tumors. Then, one day, his persistence paid off.

In a remote tribe of nomadic animal herders, he found an adolescent boy whose language circuits activated in meaningful, coherent speech patterns without the words necessarily coming out of his mouth. It was remarkable. Nothing externally seemed wrong with the boy. He didn't seem mentally handicapped in any way - a little more reserved than the others, perhaps. Mainly, he just thought in words.

Steve tried an experiment. He translated the words "I should pick up that rock" into brain patterns, and forced the boy's neurons to activate accordingly. The reaction wasn't immediate - after Steve sent the thought, the boy's brain continued and mulled it over. "That's a neat rock", rationalized the boy. He walked over and picked it up. Steve's jaw dropped.

For the very first time, his influence extended beyond the environmental and genetic. He could reach in and play with the thoughts of one of his beings.

Steve wondered how the boy had thought before learning language, or how he would have thought had language not been developed. Intriguing. He should have to research the topic at some point. For now, though, he killed every male of reproductive age in the boy's vicinity and crossed his fingers that his natural instincts would inspire him to repopulate the tribe and the surrounding regions. It worked.

The mental bottleneck of playability was more or less evolutionarily neutral. It had some advantages - for instance, for whatever reason, the process of thinking in words seemed marginally more likely to result in novel ideas. It also had disadvantages - for example, playable characters would sometimes lapse into pathological thought loops during which they got stuck in the same conversation with themselves over and over, while their surrounding non-playable characters occupied themselves with expanding their respective lineages. It was also a genetically brittle trait - thousands of genes appeared to be involved, and if they didn't combine perfectly, the resultant ape wouldn't be playable. All in all, playability was an evolutionary wash - which meant the genes involved wouldn't become widespread without divine intervention.

Steve intervened. Everywhere the trait spread, he advanced a front of death. Breeding age males dropped dead by the thousands. Apes who weren't showing signs of playability by one year of age were ruthlessly culled. The ape population of StevieNix plummeted, and Steve began to worry about the loss of genetic diversity in other domains. Eventually, after generations of destruction, playability reached one percent of the population. Then, ten. Then, twenty. Finally, at thirty percent, Murdoch stepped in.

"Thirty percent will do us just fine, Steve."

"I can get it higher!" Steve responded. He had become singularly focused on the task at hand.

"I'm sure you can, lad. But we can't have everyone be a navel-gazing thought hamster can we?"

Steve pondered. Perhaps the pathological thought loops were more obvious that he'd estimated.

"Thirty percent is perfect", Murdoch reiterated. "It's time to move on. The alignment team is waiting."
