## 0. A Plaything for the Gods

When Steve received the design brief, it was even worse than he'd thought. Not only was he supposed to read their minds, but he had to influence them as well! He strode around his office, fuming. Gabe, who had composed himself since the previous conversation, sat on the couch and lent a sympathetic ear.

"Changing requirements!" Steve cried. "Every damn time! Why can't people just figure out what they want and ask for it up front? Why do they have to ask for one thing, then ask for something completely different once that first thing is delivered?"

"Oh, I know" sympathized Gabe, who didn't really (no one ever asked him for anything).

"These minds are insanely complicated! We're talking billions of parallel matrix operations, all bathed in a sea of hormones! It's a miracle they do anything! How's anyone supposed to understand them?"

"I guess he just thinks really highly of you."

Steve slumped into his chair. "It's just impossible. Six months' work, down the drain. I'm going to have to start again from scratch, with this stupid requirement baked into the universe somehow."

"Surely not!" said Gabe. "There's gotta be some way to hack it in. So the problem is that the thought space is too big, right?"

"Yes. Way, way, way too big."

"Can you focus on just one part of the mind?"

"They think with their whole minds."

"What if they didn't?"

"Huh?"

"What if you forced all their thoughts through a bottleneck, and just figured out how to understand and manipulate that bottleneck?"

Steve's initial reaction was "they would be profoundly mentally impacted", but realized that there was a candidate bottleneck - the language center.

Mapping the language center was relatively straightforward. He picked some random apes and recorded their neural activation levels every time they spoke. Over time, he built a huge corpus of neural activity and associated language, and trained a simple classifier to map the two datasets together. The result was a program that allowed him to transcribe the words they spoke by watching their neurons - a neat party trick, but insufficient to read their actual thoughts. 

He started running his neuron/speech classifier on the apes' thoughts while they were not talking. The results were garbage. He tried hand-writing genes to route all thoughts through the language center. Most of the resultant apes died, the rest produced garbage. He increased cosmic radiation to try to get more mutations, but instead of new neural patterns he mostly got tumors and garbage. Then, one day, his persistence paid off.

In a remote tribe of nomadic animal herders, he found an adolescent boy whose language circuits activated in meaningful, coherent speech patterns without the words necessarily coming out of his mouth. It was remarkable. Nothing externally seemed wrong with the boy. He didn't seem mentally handicapped in any way - a little more reserved than the others, perhaps. Mainly, he just thought in words.

Steve tried an experiment. He translated the words "I should pick up that rock" into neural patterns, and shoved them into the boy's mind. The reaction wasn't immediate - after Steve sent the thought, the boy mulled it over. "That's a neat rock", rationalized the boy. "Maybe one of the girls in the valley will like it." He walked over and picked it up. Steve's jaw dropped.

For the very first time, his influence extended beyond the environmental and genetic. He could reach in and play with thoughts.

Steve wondered how his "playable character" had thought before learning language. Intriguing. He should have to research the topic at some point. For now though, he killed every male of reproductive age in the boy's vicinity and crossed his fingers that his natural instincts would inspire him to repopulate the tribe and surrounding regions. It worked, somewhat. A few of his kids were playable too.

From an evolutionary perspective, the mental bottleneck of playability was more or less neutral. It had some advantages - for whatever reason, the process of thinking in words seemed marginally more likely to result in novel ideas. It also had disadvantages - for example, playable characters would sometimes fall into pathological thought loops while their competing non-playable characters freely mated and expanded their respective lineages. It was also a genetically brittle trait - thousands of genes appeared to be involved, and if they didn't combine perfectly, the resultant ape wouldn't be playable. All in all, the evolutionary neutrality meant that playability genes wouldn't become widespread without divine intervention.

Steve therefore intervened. Everywhere the trait spread, he advanced a front of death. Breeding age males dropped dead by the thousands. Apes who weren't showing signs of playability by one year of age were ruthlessly culled. The ape population of StevieNix plummeted, and Steve began to worry about the loss of genetic diversity in other domains. Eventually, after generations of destruction, playability reached one percent of the population. Then ten, then twenty. Finally, at thirty percent, Murdoch stepped in.

"Thirty percent will do us just fine, Steve."

"I can get it higher!" Steve responded. He had become singularly focused on the task at hand.

"I'm sure you can, lad. But we can't have everyone be a navel-gazing thought hamster can we?"

Steve blushed. Perhaps the pathological thought loops were more obvious that he'd estimated.

"Thirty percent is perfect", Murdoch reiterated. "It's time to move on. The alignment team is waiting."
