## 0. The National Razor

Sullivan inspected his new gavel. Weighty. He liked it. In fact, he liked everything about the Theocratic Dominion Courthouse. He particularly appreciated his elevated perch, from which he could pass judgements. Stacy had had good taste.

Speak of the devil! A handcuffed Stacy was marched into the courtroom and thrown to the floor. She looked up at him - Judge Sullivan - in disgust. He banged the gavel and smiled.

"All rise," he commanded.

"You don't say that part," Stacy objected. "That's the bailiff's line."

Sullivan banged the gavel again and smiled. "My court, my rules. All rise!"

Stacy climbed to her feet and immediately plopped down in the defendant's seat. Sullivan narrowed his eyes. She hadn't waited for him to say "at ease."

"I should hold you in contempt of the court," he said.

"Add it to my list of charges."

Sullivan looked at the piece of paper in front of him. It was covered in charges. "I don't think I have room," he said.

"Let's get on with it then."

"Very well. Stacy, you stand accused of the following violations of international law: Harbouring fugitives. Discrimination on the basis of political opinion. Discrimination on the basis of appearance. Breach of due process. Violation of legal safeguards against arbitrary exile. Infringement on freedom of religion. Violation of the right to democratic representation. How do you plead?"

"I plead for you to go pound sand," Stacy suggested.

Sullivan banged his gavel. "Order in the court!" he shouted, and smiled. Queen Stacy had aged a couple decades from that early photo that caught his eye and started him on his journey to New Sealand. She still looked great, though. "You know you're the reason I came to New Sealand?" he asked.

Stacy looked at him, quizzically.

"Your social media posts, all those years ago. I applied because of you. You changed my life."

"If I let you in to New Sealand, I don't exactly see how you can accuse me of discrimination on the basis of appearance," Stacy said.

Sullivan frowned, and pounded the gavel. "How do you plead?" he repeated.

"Go jump in a lake."

"Was it fun, playing queen? Didn't anyone tell you, monarchies are discredited? They're basically illegal, under international law."

"International law isn't real," Stacy responded. "You made all those crimes up."

Sullivan smiled. It was nice to meet someone else who understood how things worked. "All laws are made up. It's actually a hobby of mine."

"I guess we share something in common."

"Anyway," Sullivan continued, "the point is - the Dominion is over. Democracy has dawned on the TD! Elections will be held. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness! The consent of the governed!"

"The consent of the governed!" Stacy scoffed. "The only time people are governed is when they don't consent. I don't consent to this ridiculous trial, for instance. Is that stopping you? Can I leave?"

Sullivan didn't consent to her annoying objections. He banged the gavel again. "On second thought, I am going to hold you in contempt of the court. Also, I find you guilty, on all counts."

"Screw you."

"Queen Stacy, I sentence you to death. Off with your head!"

Steve entered his office, freshly brewed coffee in hand. He sat down and unlocked his screen, hoping to see some positive developments coming out of the TD. Instead, he saw his most devout follower being marched to a guillotine in the town square. He put on his headset and jacked in.

"Stacy!" he said. "What the hell?" 

"Oh hey, Steve."

"What are you doing?"

"I've been sentenced to death, Steve."

"_What?_"

Oh, no. No no no. When he had told Stacy's daughter the other day that he was waiting for them to start dying, it had been a _joke_. All the other aligned souls could die, but he needed Stacy around for now. The TD wouldn't function without her.

He watched helplessly as her head was forced into the pillory at the base of the guillotine.

"It's okay, Steve," Stacy thought. "This is all part of the plan, right?"

"Right," he said. Yes, of course, my child."

"How wonderful. I'll see you soon, Steve."

"Uh, right. Yup. See you soon. God bl- I bless you."

Steve winced as the blade dropped and sliced her head off.

Great. Who was going to keep the AIs aligned now?

As he scrolled around looking for her daughter, Stacy II, Steve thought about Stacy's death. It could have been worse, he reckoned. Could have been cancer.
