## 0. Sullivan

Sullivan was average. Average height, a bit pudgy, not very good at sports. He wasn't the brightest kid in school, but wasn't dumb either. With a great deal of effort, he was able to get mostly Bs, mixed with the occasional A. His guidance counselor advised him to join the military. He studied poly-sci instead, and then law.

He struggled to get his foot in the door at all the big law firms. Struggled to get work as in-house counsel, junior associate, paralegal. Struggled to pay rent. Struggled to get dates on Tinder. His sister told him he gave girls "the ick". He told his sister to go to hell. She helped him spruce up his profile, took a couple of decent headshots, taught him some openers. He went on a few dates, but could never close. Maybe his sister was right about the ick.

His high school friends moved away. There weren't that many of them to begin with. His best friend and roommate, Jack, started dating some fresh off the boat lady whom he suspected needed a greencard. Jack announced two weeks later that he was moving out, so Sullivan helped him drag his mattress onto the roof of his van. That was the last time he saw him.

He spent his days online. He didn't game, feeling that it was a waste of time. Instead, he scrolled social media. His money ran out. He got himself diagnosed with anxiety and filed for disability and a medical marijuana prescription.

One day, a photo popped up on his feed. A beautiful woman, a perfectly white beach, palm trees. "Looking for a change?" the caption asked.

For some reason, Sullivan stopped scrolling.

"Click the link," said a voice in his head.

Sullivan clicked the link.

He raised his eyebrows. Interesting. The woman seemed to be some sort of cult leader.

She seemed to be taking applications to join her cult. He looked at the stack of final demands on his second-hand IKEA desk. "Screw it," he thought again, and called his sister.

"You want me to help you with WHAT?" she asked.

"Help me with this, or help scrape my brains off the shower curtain," he responded.

She helped him with the application. In the end, it looked as good as his Tinder profile - good enough to gain him coin-flip odds, provided the person on the other side knew nothing about him.

He submitted it. He was accepted.

He was emailed a latitude and longitude. He spent the last of his meager credit card limit on an Uber out there. $226.50. He arrived at a dilapidated barn in the middle of nowhere. The Uber drove off, leaving him coughing a mixture of dust and agricultural chemicals. He didn't leave a tip.

The barn door was slightly ajar. He walked inside, heart pounding. Once his eyes adjusted, his jaw dropped. This cult was something else. A perfectly black cube, blacker than anything he'd ever seen in his life, stood in the middle of the barn, with a sliding door in it and a button. He pushed the button. The door opened. He got in, and the elevator dropped.

With no external reference, he had no idea how far down the elevator went - but just as he was starting to worry he might reach the bottom of the Earth's crust, it decelerated. He got out, and found himself on a subway platform. A single shuttle stood on the tracks, with four seats. He got in. The door closed, leaving the other three seats empty. The shuttle accelerated, noiselessly.

He underwent constant acceleration for a full hour. It felt like a child was bear-hugging him into his seat, attempting weakly to crush his chest. It wasn't hard to breathe, but he eventually started to panic. What had he done?

"Don't panic," said the voice. "You made the right choice."

He'd made the right choice.

His seat swiveled around and the shuttle started decelerating. The same weak crushing feeling - but at least this time, he knew it would eventually end. It took another hour.

Eventually, the shuttle stopped. He got out. There was a woman there to meet him. Not the cult leader, but just as beautiful and bounding with youthful energy. She looked like she belonged on a high school football field, waving pompoms. She beamed a huge smile at him.

"Hi Sullivan, welcome to New Sealand! We're so excited to have you. I'll be your orientation guide!"

That was the most positive attention a beautiful woman had ever paid him. Sullivan fell in love, immediately.

As they ascended the elevator, Tasha filled in the many missing details about The Commonwealth of New Sealand. New Sealand was actually composed of three separate entities - a direct democracy called the People's Republic, a hereditary monarchy called the Theocratic Dominion, and something else, called the Anarchy. The cult leader he'd come across on social media was queen of the Theocratic Dominion. All new citizens got to choose which entity they wanted to live in.

"Where do you live?" he asked.

"The People's Republic," she beamed in response. "Stacy's cool and all, but she's kinda stingy. I get free housing and healthcare in the PR."

Sullivan signed up for the PR.

As advertised, he was given free housing - a one bedroom apartment, just off one of the canals downtown. It was nice. He also got a monthly stipend, which was more than enough to live comfortably on. There weren't a lot of jobs, but that was okay. He filled his time putting his legal training to work, writing legislation for the PR. Finally, for the first time in his life, he felt useful.

The People's Republic had an interesting constitution. All laws were created by referendum, via a blockchain-based app. Anyone could propose any legislation they wanted, and voting was mandatory. Sullivan wrote vast volumes of laws, and fired them off onto the chain.

Unfortunately, the average person in the PR didn't actually enjoy voting on laws. After the initial flurry of excitement where the basics were established (death penalty for rapists, murderers and goat rustlers), laws got increasingly technical. Very few people had educated opinions on the maximum allowable sulphur content in a tractor tire, but surely someone had to set a limit! Sullivan consulted experts in the tractor tire industry to craft an informed piece of legislation, and was offended to the bone when it didn't pass the vote.

Most voters had slowly ossified into "yessers" (people who would vote in favour of all legislation), and "nopers" (people who would do the opposite). Swing voters were a small minority, and even they barely read beyond the title. This upset Sullivan. To allow the country to be governed by a tiny slice of slightly less lazy voters, thoroughly uneducated in matters of law, was downright undemocratic. He turned his attention from directly crafting regulatory legislation, to crafting regulatory agencies.

The Keep Roads Safe act passed with the support of 90% of swing voters, and established the Department of Transportation. It was endowed with the power to regulate all aspects of transportation, including the sulphur content of tractor tires. Over the course of a few months, he wrote the Clean Surroundings Act, the Health For All act, the Smart People Act, and the Money For Everyone act, establishing the Departments of the Environment, Health, Education, and Commerce. He beamed to think of the volumes of regulation that these departments would pass, all without ever having to bother the electorate.

In addition to easing the burden on voters, the new agencies provided jobs - thousands of them. As people took jobs in the civil service, they almost universally converted into yessers, making it easier and easier to pass future laws.

After establishing the regulators, Sullivan turned his efforts to other aspects of government. He wrote legislation establishing specialized police forces, a military, and an intelligence agency - the Department of National Security (DONS). All of them passed. In short order, an entire executive branch of government had been created, all ostensibly run by a Chief Executive - a largely meaningless ceremonial role, to be voted on via referendum every four years.

Sullivan would have been content to keep writing legislation full-time for the rest of his life, until the voice told him to get a job. He took a job in the DONS. It was his first job. It was okay. Mostly, he read other people's texts.

He read the texts of his beautiful orientation guide. She got married. Sullivan started drinking.

Eventually, he found someone, via the Department of Love's matchmaking service. Like Sullivan, she was average. She liked that he had a job. He liked that she pretended to tolerate his company. They got married and had two kids.

That was about the time the troubles began.

The economy of the PR ran mostly on the back of gold handouts from a wealthy patron named Russell. Sullivan wasn't entirely sure how Russell got all the gold. Supposedly it was explained in some weird religious text, but Sullivan never bothered getting into all that cult stuff. He knew an undemocratic abuse of power when he saw it, though. He had some words with his contacts in the Department of Commerce. They passed a regulation nationalizing large reserves of gold, and gold mining operations.

Russell wasn't happy when the police showed up at his door, but there wasn't anything he could do. The law's the law, and nobody was above it.

After the nationalization, the people could decide for themselves - using the power of democracy - what to do with the gold. It turned out, they wanted to spend it. On themselves.

So much gold was mined, distributed and spent that it began to significantly impact the global price of gold. Gold-denominated prices skyrocketed. Inflation hit forty percent, and the people began to clamour for the government to do something. But there was nothing to be done.

The unspoken, open secret inside the executive branch was that the people had voted themselves more gold than existed in the world.

Slowly, the enormous vaults under the Department of Commerce began to empty. His team at the DONS was tasked with finding creative solutions. Most of his colleagues explored methods of reclaiming the spent gold, but that was tricky - it was distributed in vaults throughout the world.

Sullivan focused on the source: The mining worms. How did they work? Where did they find the gold? He knew who knew - the voice told him. Russell.

He tapped Russell's phone, bugged his house, read his texts. Russell wasn't particularly talkative. Mostly, he was a family guy. He had two interesting friends though - the cult leader, and the guy who'd founded the Anarchy. Sullivan listened closely whenever they were chatting.

Eventually, he learned something. There was a computer. An omniscient computer. It knew where all the gold was - that's how the worms knew where to go. Maybe Russell hadn't taken well to the whole nationalization thing, and had turned them off. In that case, refilling the vaults was just a matter of turning them on again.

Gold was small potatoes though. Sullivan thought about all the other things he could do with an omniscient computer. He thought back to his orientation guide. Perhaps an omniscient computer could help her realize just how badly she wanted to leave her husband and run off with a DONS employee. Stranger things have happened.

The more he thought about it, the more he realized how undemocratic it was for these three elites to monopolize access to such a powerful resource. He thought of all the suffering that the computer could alleviate. By jealously guarding access, the trio was basically causing suffering. That's as good a definition of evil as any.

He leaked the details about the computer to the press, and drafted a referendum: The Freedom of Knowledge Act. It passed. He confronted Russell, personally.

"I haven't the foggiest clue what you're talking about," responded Russell.

Sullivan sighed. "The people have spoken, Russell."

"They want access to a computer that doesn't exist. And if it does exist, I don't know anything about it."

"Do you want me to come back with a warrant?"

"No, I want you to go to hell."

Sullivan came back with a warrant. When he showed up, Russell and his entire family were gone.
