## 0. Sullivan

Sullivan considered blowing his head off in the shower. Pros: Quick, painless, hard for him to screw up, like he had everything else in his life. Cons: Where would he even get a gun? Can you just buy one at a pawn shop? Do you need a license? Huge faff.

Sleeping pills. Pros: Painless, less messy, no license necessary. Cons: You could only buy them in packs of 12 at a time, so he'd have to go round to all the local pharmacies. How many pills did it take to kill yourself anyway? Not as big a faff as the gun, but still...

Sullivan sighed and took another drag on his medically-prescribed joint. Man, killing yourself was a lot of work.

He switched to the tab where he kept his job search spreadsheet. Another day, another rejection. "Unfortunately, we are unable to proceed with your candidacy at this time."

Law firms, man. Incapable of recognizing genius.

He struck out row eight hundred and fourteen in the sheet. The unemployment office needed evidence of an active job search. He'd provided it, for three straight years.

Having reached the minimum threshold of state-mandated job applications for the week, he closed the tab, stumbled to the fridge, and retrieved the box of chicken wings from two nights ago. Flopping back in his desk chair, he scrolled his social media feed as he ate the cold wings and theorized about other ways to end his miserable existence.

Hanging. Pros: Cheap, hard to screw up, minimal equipment requirements. Cons: Cons...hmm.

No cons.

Wow, she was hot. Some athletic blonde in a red bikini top and a matching skirt had just shown up on his feed. She was in a bamboo pergola, holding a fruity cocktail and smiling while waves danced in the background.

"Come join me!" said the caption.

Sure sounded nice.

"Click the link," said a voice in his head. "The one in the bio."

Sullivan clicked the link in the bio. Okay, this was weird. She was some sort of cult leader. She was taking applications.

Join the cult. Pros: Hot girls, communal food, can stop applying to jobs. Cons: Cons...hmm.

No cons.

He submitted an application and waited for the email saying "Unfortunately, we are unable to proceed with your candidacy at this time."

It didn't come. Instead, he was accepted.

He was emailed a latitude and longitude. The Uber out there cost the last of his meager credit limit.$226.50. He didn't tip. He arrived at a dilapidated barn in the middle of nowhere. The Uber drove off, leaving him coughing a mixture of dust and agricultural chemicals.

The barn door was slightly ajar. He walked inside, heart pounding. Once his eyes adjusted, his jaw dropped. This cult was something else. A perfectly black cube, blacker than anything he'd ever seen in his life, stood in the middle of the barn, with a sliding door in it and a button. He pushed the button. The door opened. He got in, and the elevator dropped.

With no external reference, he had no idea how far down the elevator went - but just as he was starting to worry he might reach the bottom of the Earth's crust, it decelerated. He got out, and found himself on a subway platform. A single shuttle stood on the tracks, with four seats. He got in. The door closed, leaving the other three seats empty. The shuttle took off down the tracks.

After an hour of constant acceleration, followed by an hour of constant braking, the shuttle stopped. He got out. There was a woman there to meet him. Not the cult leader, but perhaps even hotter? She looked like she belonged on a college football field, waving pompoms. She beamed a huge smile at him.

"Hi Sullivan, welcome to New Sealand! We're so excited to have you. I'm Tasha, your orientation guide!"

Sullivan had never loved anyone or anything as much as he loved Tasha in that moment.

As they ascended the elevator, Tasha filled in the many missing details about The Commonwealth of New Sealand. New Sealand was actually composed of three separate entities - a direct democracy called the People's Republic, a hereditary monarchy called the Theocratic Dominion, and something else, called the Anarchy. The cult leader he'd come across on social media was queen of the Theocratic Dominion. All new citizens got to choose which entity they wanted to live in.

"Where do you live?" he asked.

"The People's Republic," Tasha said. "Stacy's cool and all, but she's kinda stingy. Russell, on the other hand..."

Sullivan signed up for the PR.

He was assigned a one bedroom downtown apartment and given a comfortable monthly stipend. There weren't a lot of jobs, but that was okay. He found a way to be useful.

The PR had a referendum-based legal system. Everyone could vote on legislation, but someone had to write it. Sullivan heroically stepped into the role, drafting vast tomes of legalese and firing them off onto the chain. Unfortunately, his efforts weren't always appreciated. Most of his laws failed to pass the vote.

"Why are you doing this?" Tasha asked him when he showed her his latest work. "No one cares about how much sulphur goes into a tractor tire."

Oh, Tasha. Her simpleminded takes only made her more beautiful.

"Someone needs to set a limit!" he explained. "Otherwise, it'll be bedlam!"

"All I'm saying is, I'm not surprised that no one's voting to limit the sulphur content of a tractor tire to blah blah blah parts per million. People care about things like safety, not...weird trivial regulations."

Oh, silly woman. It wasn't her fault - her nature was simply unsuited to carrying the burden of legislation. Most people were the same way. Russell must not have understood this when he'd drafted the PR's constitution: To put the law in the hands of the average simpleton, particularly the ones whose...natural talents were more...domestically oriented, was downright undemocratic.

No worries. Sullivan could fix it.

He stopped crafting regulations. Waste of time. Instead, he crafted regulatory agencies.

His first success was the Keep Roads Safe act. It passed - after all, who would vote for dangerous roads? The act established the Department of Transportation.

Tasha didn't seem to care very much when he told her. Maybe transportation wasn't her thing. He went on to write the Clean Surroundings Act, the Health For All act, the Smart People Act, and the Money For Everyone act.

She seemed less and less enthusiastic about spending time with him. On their final date (or as she called it, a "scheduled meetup"), he proudly recounted how he'd single-handedly established the Departments of the Environment, Health, Education, and Commerce.

"It sounds like you're fully settled in now," Tasha said.

"Oh, yes. I'm a People's Republican, through and through."

"How wonderful! I guess your orientation is complete, then."

What was she getting at?

"No, I got lost on the way to the grocery store the other day. I still need orienting."

"I'll be marking your file as 'fully oriented,'" she said as she slipped off her bar stool. "Wonderful to have met you, Sullivan. I hope you enjoy your life in the PR."

"No! Tasha!"

She slipped into the crowd and out of his life.

The bitch.

That night, Sullivan wrote the Preventing Terrorism Act. After all, who would vote to enable terrorism? The act established the Department of National Security. It passed.

He took a job at the DONS. His first proper job. He used his security clearance to read Tasha's texts.

She'd been engaged the whole time. The two-timing, streetwalking, hussy.

He went home early and got blackout drunk. The next day, he slumped in his office chair, eyes closed, head pounding, processing a revelation: People suck. They make stupid decisions. They have to be managed.

He had discovered his purpose.

And so, he spent the next twenty years. DONS agent by day, legislator by night. A manager of people. An unsung hero.

"New assignment," his new boss announced, walking through the sea of cubicles and distributing manila folders. "The Department of Commerce needs a favour."

Sullivan hid his phone in his top drawer before the tall, well-dressed asshole strutted past his desk. Ever since this guy had gotten the job, the office had gotten a lot less relaxed. Always walking around, distributing folders...

Sullivan received his folder and extracted the brief. Ah, the gold thing again. Guy needed some new material.

"This is critically important," his boss announced. "The future of the republic depends on our success here."

Sullivan stifled a yawn. A few months ago, Russell had tried cutting back the monthly gold stipend. The Department of Commerce had responded by nationalizing his gold reserves. The people, sensing a moment of opportunity, had responded by voting themselves a bigger stipend.

Much bigger. By some estimates, they'd voted themselves more gold than existed on the planet.

"The vaults under the Department of Commerce are starting to empty," his boss continued. "If that's allowed to happen, we're done here. Pack it up, go home, try to get a hyperloop back to the mainland before the PR descends into cannibalism."

Sullivan continued scanning the brief. Cannibalism wasn't mentioned.

"You are each being given wide latitude - solve the problem as you see fit. You'll have an enormous budget, enhanced interrogation facilities, and a special forces unit."

As he saw fit, eh? Sullivan began brainstorming ways to fix the gold problem with legislation.

"And Sullivan?"

Sullivan looked up. The tall, slickly-dressed, greasy-pole climber loomed over his desk, smiling. The prick must get his teeth whitened on a bi-weekly basis.

"Try to leave the office this time," he said. "This isn't the sort of problem you can solve from behind your desk."

---

Sullivan's butt was sore. He'd spent the past week at a secluded table in the DONS cafeteria, hunched over his laptop and avoiding that tailored-suit dickhead. He missed his padded, ergonomic office chair and couldn't wait for this assignment to be over. Maybe if he saved the republic, he could score a promotion - or, at the very least, a transfer to a different department.

Russell's wiretap played through his headphones. A voice in his head had suggested monitoring his comms. So far, Sullivan had learned that Russell was in constant communication with the cult lady and an anarchist. They were always talking about some sort of computer. Their conversations seemed to imply that the computer was omniscient?

That can't be right.

His laptop dinged and a notification popped up - his search was done. He clicked the notification and his browser navigated to the past twenty years of Russell's text message history. Time to get to the bottom of this.

Two hours later, he was convinced: The computer was omniscient. He didn't know why and didn't care how. The fact was, these three elites were jealously guarding a resource that could not only save the republic and net Sullivan his promotion, but also...dunno. Lift billions out of poverty, or whatever. 

Anyway, it was downright undemocratic. Sullivan leaked details of the computer to the press, and drafted a referendum: The Freedom of Knowledge Act.

---

The referendum passed. Sullivan confronted Russell, personally.

"I have no idea what you're talking about," said Russell.

Sullivan sighed. "The people have spoken, Russell. Where's the computer?"

"The people are idiots. The computer doesn't exist. And if it did exist, I don't know anything about it."

"Do you want me to come back with a warrant?"

"No, I want you to go to hell."

Sullivan came back with a warrant. When he showed up, Russell and his entire family were gone.
