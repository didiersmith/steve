## 0. The Terrarium

Xavier was keen to return to his project and forget the events of the previous day. He left his dad to catch his mom up on recent events, and slipped into his hangar-sized laboratory. The ASIC was waiting patiently in its towering diamond cylinder, bathed in coolant.

Xavier sat down at his computer. He had a vision in his head, but no clue if it would be physically possible. He had the MHI-10 help him design an extremely powerful fusion-driven vacuum pump, which he built and attached to an igloo-shaped diamond chamber. He slipped some manufacturing robots and materials through the igloo's airlock, ran back to his computer, and re-opened his 1cm sphere design in the CAM program. He clicked "run".

The tiny marble appeared in the center of the igloo. He had the robots push the marble into the airlock, and released the vacuum.

As the air rushed in to fill the airlock, the marble floated upwards. By the time Xavier was able to turn the airlock handle and open the door, it was pressed against the airlock ceiling. He picked it up and rolled it around in his hands. It was a strange sensation, rolling around a ball that kept trying to fall upwards. Eventually, he let it go, and the impossibly light ball slowly floated up to rest in a cranny in the the laboratory ceiling.

Xavier went back into CAD, dragged a resize handle on the sphere, flicked into CAM, and hit "run". A basketball-sized web of super-thin wires appeared on the floor of the igloo, before being filled out with black carbon. The robots pushed the ball into the airlock. Xavier released the pressure again and opened the airlock door.

This time, the buoyant force was much greater. Xavier struggled to keep hold of the perfectly smooth basketball. Eventually, he gave up on the wrestling match and let the ball shoot up to the ceiling to join its smaller sibling.

Xavier cackled. He was going to need a bigger igloo.

When his dad entered the laboratory later to check on him, he found him floating in a basket mid-air, dangling from what looked like a small, black hot-air balloon, laughing hysterically.

Xavier had always found volumes difficult to picture. The rapidity with which they increased always took him by surprise.

He had specified his first "no-air balloon" to have a lifting capacity of 100kg - enough to hold him, equipment, ballast, and the balloon itself. The diameter of the required sphere came out to a little over 5 meters.

His next iteration had a lifting capacity of 1,000 kg. To his surprise, he could accomplish this with an 11 meter diameter sphere. For 10,000 kilos, a 25 meter sphere sufficed. To lift a million kilos, he would only need a 116 meter diameter sphere. Shorter than an Aussie rules football field.

He tinkered with the carbon nanostructures until he produced a few-atom-thick material with the transparency of diamond and the robustness of carbon fiber. It was much more aesthetically pleasing than the pure black of his first balloon. He designed a "swim bladder" to control the altitude of the balloon by adjusting the mass - it worked by compressing atmospheric air into a tank. Then, he built the Terrarium.

In keeping with tradition, the Terrarium was a hexagon. Instead of one huge sphere, Vincent split the load between six zeppelin-shaped ellipsoids, one at each corner. The Terrarium could still fly (albeit at an angle) with the loss of any two ellipsoids, and could "safely land" (ie. crash into the ocean without tearing apart) with the loss of any three. The living area ("cabin") had a surface area of 1 hectare, was fully enclosed to maintain comfortable temperature and pressure at high altitude, and was covered with a layer of lightweight hydroponic growing medium 15 centimeters deep. The cabin was well planted with leafy plants and fruit trees, and could sustain a population of eight protops and fifty humans.

His dad's entire crew helped to build it out. So many former crewmembers and their families volunteered to join the population that he had to limit the slots on a first come, first served basis.

The evening before the Terrarium's launch, his dad helped him look over his equipment. The hovering island was moored to their homestead, straining at its carbon nanotube cables and threatening to lift their entire home out of the water. What had previously felt like solid ground wobbled precariously on the waves.

"Good thing you included that big ball of lead at the bottom of the island, dad," said Xavier cheerfully.

Vincent looked worried. "Even so, we're operating well outside of the design envelope," he replied. "The structure was never meant to withstand upwards force. You're lucky the fullerene isn't pulling apart."

Xavier looked at his dad quizzically. "What are you talking about, dad? We both know how overspecced your islands are. What are you actually worried about?"

Vincent sighed. "Do you have the ASIC on board?"

"Of course! I'm not going to leave that behind for you to mess with!"

"Good."

Xavier narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "Why?"

"I haven't been able to access the MHI-10 in a few days," Vincent responded. "First time in twenty years."

Xavier's eyes slowly widened as the enormity of his newfound responsibility dawned on him. If the MHI-10 was gone, his prototype flying island now held the only nanoscale manufacturing plant in the world.

"What's the computer used for, other than manufacturing?" asked Xavier.

"Out here, nothing. The Anarchy's islands are fire-and-forget - once we build them, they're not our problem anymore. The Dominion's the same way - I don't think Stacy ever touched the computer for anything other than social media outreach. But the PR...God only knows what Russell used that thing for. In fact - have you been reading the news?"

"No," Xavier replied. "The news is boring. Should I stay here?"

"Why would you stay here?"

Xavier thought the answer was obvious. "If something goes wrong with The Terrarium, humanity loses nanoscale manufacturing forever."

Vincent laughed. "You really need to start reading the news. I'd put higher odds at something going wrong down here."

"Why, what's happening here?"

Vincent shook his head. "Problems in the PR. Big problems. The kind of problems that you would do well to fly away from."

"Great."

"Don't worry," Vincent said. "With the people you've got on board, the Terrarium will be able to handle just about anything."

Murdoch leaned back and fished a cigarette out of its packet. It was the last one - he'd have to run down to the shop and get more. He cursed FEDSEC for banning delivery of tobacco products. One of the many injustices to which he'd been subjected in the last hundred thousand years.

It would all be over soon - he had a good feeling about this player. For the first time in countless millenia, he had a viable path to escape.

He lit the cigarette and took a long drag, filling his lungs with sweet, sweet nicotine.

It had been almost sixty thousand years since his previous escape attempt. He could barely remember the details. In fact, he could barely remember most of his life at all - one of the weird side effects of an artificially extended life was that it didn't come with an artificially extended memory. Mostly, his time on Elba was a blur. His childhood and early adulthood were much crisper. Blissful times. Ambitious times.

He remembered the calibration, though. After his last escape attempt, they'd calibrated him for six hundred years. He still had the scars.

Not this time. In fact, never again. Whatever his plan was last time, this one was surely better. Even when your lifetime is a hundred thousand years, a government-sanctioned permit to construct something in space was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

He wondered why no one else knew what had caused the stars to vanish. Maybe they had memory issues as well.

Ah well, the point was moot. Everything was lining up. Between the permit, the islanders, and the army of aligned AIs, he had a real shot at making it.

He picked up his keys and whistled as he strolled to the corner store for more cigarettes.
