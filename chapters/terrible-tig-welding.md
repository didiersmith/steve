## 0. Terrible TIG Welding

Russell's hood was lifted. He squinted as his eyes adjusted to the harsh light. He was naked, zip-tied to a chair. He was freezing. A pair of wires ran from a power supply on the floor to two alligator clips attached to his scrotum. The pain was sharp and immense.

"You know, some people pay good money for this kind of treatment," said a nasal voice.

Russell turned his head to the source of the voice, and identified Sullivan. "I thought I told you to go to hell," he said.

"Maybe I did and brought you with me."

"I don't see any flames."

"I can do flames!" Sullivan chirped, and picked a blowtorch off a shelf. He ignited it briefly to show off the blue flame, before switching it off and placing it back on the shelf.  "But hopefully it won't come to that. I would prefer to have a civil conversation."

"Right. I see we're off to a good start."

"Your friend Stacy is dead," Sullivan said, matter-of-factly. "Your friends and family in the Anarchy will soon be as well. Nothing I can do about it, I'm afraid. The people demand liberty! But there is something you can do to stop it."

Russell spat at Sullivan. Sullivan ignored it. It was a common occurrence at this stage of an interrogation.

"Where is the computer?" he asked.

"I told you last time, I have no idea what you're talking about," Russell replied.

Sullivan switched on the power supply. Russell felt unimaginable pain, as if the demons of hell had descended upon his scrotum with white-hot circular saws. Sullivan switched it off. A wave of endorphins rushed over Russell.

"Where is the computer?" repeated Sullivan.

"Go to hell," Russell responded.

Room 4 was Sullivan's favourite of the Department of National Security's enhanced interrogation facilities. It was calming - something about the *feng shui*. He moved on from the power supply to the hand tool cabinet. He enjoyed working with hand tools - it felt artisanal, organic. He picked up a pair of vice grips, and set about removing Russell's fingernails.

He interrogated Russell for sixteen hours a day for the next three days. During the night, he left the interrogatee zip-tied to a crucifix with the lights and stereo on full blast, playing a loop of Hip to be Square by Huey Lewis and the News. Russell refused to crack. Sullivan began to regret executing Stacy so hastily - she probably also knew how to access the computer. How was he supposed to have known that Russell would be so damn stubborn?

The mood in the People's Republic was already starting to decline. The news of the Dominion's liberation had brought the population together in a brief, rhapsodic celebration of national pride and ideological superiority. The three days that had elapsed since then may as well have been ten years in the ADHD-afflicted consciousness of the general public. New inflation numbers had been released. Despite mathematical hijinks by the Department of Statistics, the numbers were bad. Even his wife was starting to complain about the cost of basic goods.

Sullivan was feeling the pressure. His boss was leaning hard on the team to replenish the gold reserves. Raiding the Dominion's comparatively puny vaults hadn't helped as much as anyone had hoped. What's more, the invasion had been expensive. So far, the entire operation had probably netted the PR's government less than a month of runway.

Russell was the key to ending the pain, Sullivan was sure of it. With the computer in the hands of the Executive Branch of the People's Republic, they wouldn't just fix the economy - they would fix the human condition. People would be assigned to their optimal job, and their optimal spouse. Cancers would be detected when they were a single cell. Criminals would be arrested before committing any crimes - or even better, their criminal intent would be flagged at conception and they'd be aborted in the womb.

Order would be brought to the planet. The world would know peace. Misery itself would be eradicated. Sullivan smiled to himself as he held the blowtorch to the interrogatee's feet. He truly was a savior in the making. He wondered what pose he'd strike for the magazine covers.

Russell was delirious. Huey Lewis's magnum opus played on repeat in his head even when the stereo was switched off. He had not slept in what felt like years. He was starving, burned, mutilated, humiliated. His tormentor flitted in and out of his awareness, occasionally appearing from the white haze that dominated his vision, to brandish some new repurposed implement from the hardware store.

The more Russell tried not to think about the computer, the more it filled his mind. Snippets of code scrolled across the white haze. Past chats with the LLM played out in his ears, synchronized to Hip to be Square. The IP address that he'd memorized two decades ago played over and over in his mind.

He was going to crack.

"Steve!" he thought. "God!"

Steve's voice popped into his head. "Hey Russ, how you doin?" he asked.

"Pretty good," Russell thought automatically.

"Yes, I can see that."

Russell looked around. The delirium evaporated for a moment and his awareness snapped back into full detail. He was zip-tied to the chair again. His left hand was secured by several hose clamps, which appeared to have been welded to a steel plate. His interrogator, face covered in a welding mask, was attempting to fabricate a small arch on the plate, looping directly over his horrifically burned pinky. The steel glowed red.

"Man, I really suck at TIG welding," Sullivan laughed to no one in particular. "Oh well! If at first, you don't succeed..."

Russell peered at the arch. He agreed with Sullivan's assessment of his welding abilities. His structure largely resembled a pair of miniature soft-serve ice creams put together by a fast food worker with Parkinson's. Sullivan activated the torch again, and the white-hot arc electrified the few undamaged nerves in Russell's desiccated remains of a pinky, blasting a fresh shock wave of pain directly into his brain. He slipped back into the haze.

"How have you been?" Steve asked him in his head.

"Been better," responded Russell more truthfully.

"Hah!" Steve laughed. "Been better. I bet you have! It looks like you're in quite the pickle!",

"You could say that."

"How can I help? Can't do much in the way of interventions, I'm afraid, but I can offer you an encouraging word! How about, er, 'bloody legend, mate!'"

"Cheers, mate," replied Russell. "How about you disconnect the MHI-10 before I crack and give this guy access?"

Steve paused for a moment.

"Are you sure?" he asked. "I'm seeing pretty high CPU usage on that thing. There's a lot running on it."

"I'm sure."

"It's kinda the foundation of your society."

"Goddamn it Steve! Kill the server!"

"Fine, fine. Stand by."

The line went silent for a few minutes, save the sound of Steve's keyboard. Russell was used to this.

He looked at his hand. A large chunk of the previous arch attempt had melted off, incinerating a crater through his skin and solidifying on the bone. Russell's nostrils were filled with the metallic fumes of vaporized welding wire and the stench of his own burned flesh. Sullivan was humming Hip to be Square.

Steve's voice returned. "Okay, done! Hope that doesn't cause any problems. Anything else?"

"Is my family alive?"

"Let me check." The voice paused for a few moments. "Well, the vast majority of your ancestors are dead. Your grandparents-"

"My wife and kids," Russell clarified.

"Ah, right. Yes. They're all alive."

"How is Filbert?"

"Um. Are you referring to the quality of his character, or his mortal state?"

"Mortal state."

"Very much alive."

"Thanks," responded Russell. "Last request. Kill me please."

"Oh. Are you finished down there?"

"Yes. I'm quite done."

Steve paused again. Then, "you realize I could have just done that instead of disconnecting the server, right?"

"Shut up, Steve."

"Okie dokie! Stand by!"

Sullivan successfully joined the two soft-serve ice creams together. He'd learned that the secret was to not allow the steel to overheat. He flitted the torch between the two sides of the arch, dragging the small pool of molten steel between the ice creams, bulking it up by dabbing the welding wire in as it crossed the middle. As long as he didn't keep the torch in one place too long, the steel would cool sufficiently to not liquefy into a puddle on the interrogatee's finger.

When he had finally added enough steel, he stopped and smiled. It looked pretty crude, but he could smooth it out. He walked over to the power tool cabinet and selected the angle grinder. The end result would still be rough, but "good enough for government work," as his dad used to say.

He returned to his seat, humming Hip to be Square. Damn catchy song. Something about the funky baseline. As he strategized on how best to position the grinder to not sever the interrogatee's finger, he made an uncomfortable discovery: Russell was dead.

Damn. That wasn't supposed to happen.

How was he supposed to access the computer now?

Steve held his head in his hands and scratched at his scalp. This was bad. Bad, bad, bad. In the span of a few hours, he'd lost his two best players. Unless he could turn it around quickly, New Sealand was done for. He wouldn't be able to make his monthly payment, and would plunge back into default.

He frantically searched StevieNix for a new player. One that could take over where Stacy and Russell had left off.

Where the hell was Stacy II?
