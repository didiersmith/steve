## 0. The Dogs of War

"It wasn't in the spec, but I guess it's a step in the right direction" Murdoch conceded. "It's hard to imagine someone winning an interstellar war if they can't wargame scenarios in their mind."

Steve beamed internally. This was high praise, coming from Murdoch.

"You've got other problems, though."

Steve's mood dampened.

"They're not warriors. They're brutes. There's a difference."

"What's the difference?"

"Brutes kill for food. In the case of your sim, they also kill for...reproductive opportunities. But warriors kill for something greater. Warriors kill for love, for ideology, for glory. We need warriors."

Warriors. What a design brief. The thought of killing someone was so foreign to Steve, he already considered it an accomplishment that his apes would do it for food. But killing someone for love? What does that even mean?

He set about writing genes for aggression.

His first attempts failed miserably. Senseless bloodshed overwhelmed any primitive societies his beings had managed to form. Even the smallest genetic tweaks often resulted in family members killing each other on whims. At one point, the entire species was so overwhelmed with violence that he had to wipe the slate clean in a global cataclysm and start again from the least aggressive seed population he could find.

As usual, the sexual reproduction mechanic was thwarting him. The most efficient way for an aggression gene to reproduce was to convince its organism to channel said aggression into directly propagating its genetic material. This resulted almost invariably in the larger, stronger males of the species forcing themselves upon the smaller, weaker females. While this strategy was evolutionarily successful from the perspective of the aggression genes, it was otherwise an unmitigated dysgenic disaster.

The entire idea of sexual reproduction was to accelerate evolution by allowing the organisms to evaluate each other and combine their genetic material with those deemed most fit. The freedom to evaluate the counterparty's fitness and select with whom to reproduce was foundational, and typically drove the species towards greater intelligence, greater health, and (in Steve's opinion) greater aesthetic appeal. The high aggression subgroups which lost that freedom quickly and relentlessly degenerated into stupid, unhealthy, ugly brutes who channeled any and all efforts into copulation.

"What do I do now?" he asked Gabe.

Gabe tilted his chair back and stroked his chin. "It is a tricky one, isn't it? I told you, sexual reproduction is more trouble than it's worth."

"Not helpful, Gabe."

Gabe set his chair back down and a wry grin spread over his face. "You could try taking a leaf out of Murdoch's book?"

"What, give them the tools of the inquisition?"

Gabe laughed and put on his best Irish accent. "Feckin' academics! Haven't you heard a word I've said? Fear of violent retribution! It's the cornerstone upon which all civilization is built! It's the lynchpin!" He thumped the table for effect.

"Huh", responded Steve. "Hmm."

His initial efforts at genetically engineering violent retribution against males who engaged in forced reproduction failed almost immediately. Violence against other males, he discovered, comes at high cost. Genes for aggressive retribution soon found themselves bred out as their organisms perished in their serial retributory encounters. He needed something else.

After weeks of trial and error, he made an important realization: In evolution, the survival of the organism was only of tangential importance. The utmost priority was the survival and propagation of the gene itself.

He designed a gene that, while mostly inert in females, encouraged its male bearers to engage in violent retribution - but solely against violators of their female relatives. As there was a high probability that those female relatives would carry the same gene, it no longer mattered as much if this targeted aggression led to the death of the male - the gene would live on in the females, and be passed down to her offspring. By callously ignoring sexual violence against unrelated females, the male could also limit his lifetime violent encounters to a level that gave him a chance of reproducing as well.

The introduction of this gene led to centuries of carnage. In some subgroups, it failed altogether and they regressed to the simpler, dysgenic reproduction strategy. In others, it resulted in generations of blood feud. The survivors, understanding the consequences, tended to avoid the violent reproduction strategy and policed their own ranks to discourage it.

Thus, the first love-motivated warfaring civilizations arose. Capable of extreme aggression on behalf of their kin, but also able to somewhat control themselves and live in peace - for a while at least.

The next time a battle broke out between two tribes, Steve paused the sim and invited Murdoch into his office to watch.

"The bendy-stick apes are going to eat their lunch", predicted Steve.

"I dunno", said Gabe. "The rock throwers have been around a lot longer. These bendy sticks are totally unproven in battle."

Murdoch shook his head. "I'm with Steve on this one. It's gonna come down to range."

The trio watched tensely as Steve un-paused the sim. The "bendy stick" tribe tribe had developed a novel mechanism of using a bendy stick and a string to hurl another, sharpened, stick at great speed. The technology had thus far only been used for hunting food - this was the first time any of them had seen it deployed against rival apes.

In less than an hour, Steve and Murdoch had been proved right - it came down to range, and the rock thowers were completely flattened. Before long, males of the rock throwing tribe had all been either killed, or bound and castrated - presumably for slave labour. The females were distributed as prizes of war among the victorious males, who immediately set about consummating their victory in the bload-soaked streets of the vanquished village.

Steve and Gabe winced and looked away. Murdoch stroke his chin thoughtfully. Gabe turned to face him.

"We want to give these things weapons? In our world?"

"That's the idea, yes."

"That's the craziest idea anyone has ever had."

"I've had crazier ones."

"Did neither of you see what I just saw?" Gabe exploded. "These things are killing machines! Completely nuts!" Turning red, he stood up abruptly and marched out of the office, slamming the door behind him.

Steve and Murdoch remained silently at the table. Steve chewed on his pen. Eventually, he spoke.

"Don't worry about him, he'll come around."

"I'm not worried."

"I've got to admit, he does have a point. They're volatile. Giving them weapons up here seems...inadvisable."

Murdoch shrugged. "Steve, just step back for a moment and look at what you've achieved. In the past six months, you've transformed these monkeys from primitive animals that only care about eating and mating, to sentient beings who can mass produce weaponry, train in groups, premeditate battle plans, and then carry those plans to fruition. That's incredible! I get that you feel bad for the rock tribe, but you've got to let it go, lad."

Steve blushed. He still wasn't used to having his work complimented.

Murdoch continued. "Look. Firstly, the rock throwers had it in for the bendy stick people anyway. It was kill or be killed. But more importantly - you didn't see a flower picking tribe, did you?"

Steve shook his head.

"Why do you think that is?"

Steve knew why it was. Any tribe that was not prepared to wage war was immediately wiped off the map by a tribe that was. "So what's your plan for making sure these apes don't turn us into the rock throwing tribe?" he asked.

"Ah yes, I was getting to that. I have another ask. We need to be able to read their minds."

Steve laughed. Murdoch stared at him, deadpan. Steve stopped laughing. Murdoch was serious.
