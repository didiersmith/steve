## 0. The Dogs of War

Steve announced the unexpected development to Murdoch. He tried not to breathe as Murdoch took a long, thoughtful drag on a cigarette and exhaled the smoke all over his enormous, wood-paneled office.

"It wasn't in the spec," Murdoch said, "but I guess it's a step in the right direction. It's hard to imagine someone winning an interstellar war if they can't wargame scenarios in their mind."

Steve beamed. 'A step in the right direction' was high praise, coming from Murdoch.

"You've got other problems, though."

Steve's mood dampened.

"They're not warriors. They're brutes. There's a difference."

"What's the difference?"

"Brutes kill for food. In the case of your sim, they also kill for...reproductive opportunities. But warriors kill for something greater. Warriors kill for love, ideology, glory. We need warriors."

Warriors. What a design brief. The thought of killing someone was so foreign to Steve, he already considered it an accomplishment that his apes would do it for food. But killing someone for love? What does that even mean?

He parked the question for later and set about experimenting with genes for aggression.

---

Bloody hell! Again? These goddamned animals.

All of his attempts at an aggression gene failed the same way: With senseless bloodshed overwhelming every primitive society in StevieNix. He thought he'd really dialed it back this time, but the proof was in the pudding.

The carnage-filled, bloodsoaked pudding. Once again, everyone in StevieNix was trying to kill each other. Sighing, Steve scoured the gene pool to rescue the few survivors who hadn't yet been polluted with his latest gene, before clicking the "cataclysm" button and starting again. He tapped his pen impatiently on his desk as he watched the sea levels rise and drown all the homicidal savages.

Man, this was tiring. On to the next gene.

---

Sexual Reproduction: A Meta-Meta Heuristic Algorithm for Screwing Everything Up. He should re-title his thesis.

His weeks of relentless experimentation had produced exactly one notable result: Sex plus violence equals dysgenics.

Honestly, the result was so obvious that he was embarrassed it took him so long to realize: The most efficient way for an aggression gene to reproduce, was to inspire sexual violence.

In StevieNix, this invariably resulted in the larger, stronger males of the species forcing themselves upon the smaller, weaker females. While this strategy was evolutionarily successful from the perspective of the aggression gene, it was otherwise an unmitigated dysgenic disaster.

They'd just done it again. It was enough to turn an academic to drink.

Steve chewed his fingernails as he watched yet another enormous population of apes degenerate into hideous brutes, channeling all their efforts into forced copulation. God fricking damnit. Sexual reproduction was supposed to _accelerate_ evolution! What the hell was this?

"What do I do now?" he asked Gabe.

Gabe tilted his chair back and stroked his chin. "It is a tricky one, isn't it? I told you, sexual reproduction is more trouble than it's worth."

"Not helpful, Gabe."

Gabe set his chair back down and a wry grin spread over his face. "You could try taking a leaf out of Murdoch's book?"

"What, give them the tools of the inquisition?"

Gabe laughed and put on his best Irish accent. "Feckin' academics! Haven't you heard a word I've said? Fear of violent retribution! It's the cornerstone of civilization! It's the lynchpin!" He thumped the table for effect.

"Huh," responded Steve. "Hmm."

---

Violent retribution. On behalf of the females. How do you encode that in a gene?

Steve tapped his keyboard. Maybe like...this?

He sped up the sim and went to make a coffee. When he came back, his gene was gone. Fully bred out of the gene pool. Okay - not like that, then.

His next few attempts also failed almost immediately. Violence against other males, it turns out, comes at high cost. Males with a propensity for aggressive retribution eventually met their match - typically before passing on their genes.

So, that was the setup. Violence against females? Cheap and rewarding. Violence against males? Dangerous and unprofitable. What a situation. He turned back to Gabe for help.

"What are you doing, thinking about the apes so much?" Gabe asked, helping himself to one of the biscuits on Steve's desk.

"What am I supposed to think about?"

"Wasn't half your thesis about how the organisms are irrelevant? They basically exist as vessels for propagating the genes?"

"You read my thesis?"

Gabe snorted. "I don't have to read your thesis, you basically narrated the entire thing to me."

Steve sighed. Of course Gabe hadn't read his thesis. He was right though - in genetic engineering, the organism is of only tangential importance. The real goal is the survival and propagation of the gene itself. "Thanks for the reminder."

"No problem. By the way, you're out of biscuits."

Time to make sexual dimorphism actually work for him. He kicked Gabe out of his office and spent the next several weeks designing his most complicated gene yet. He called it the "sister guarder".

In females, it did nothing. Completely inert. In males, it inspired violent retribution - but, crucially, only on behalf of his female relatives. From the perspective of the sister guarder gene, brothers were expendible assets. Tangential importance. The gene copy in the sister was the the one that mattered.

Steve spliced the sister guarder into a few embryos, sat back, and watched. Immediate carnage ensued - but this time, it was different. This time, the problem wasn't so much sexual violence, but...blood feud.

Generations and generations of blood feud. Steve reached for a biscuit from his recently-refilled tin and munched away as he watched entire families wipe each other out in century-long vendettas. Well, that was a new one.

As he depleted his biscuit tin, a calmness spread across StevieNix. Worried that the sister guarder gene had been bred out, Steve inspected a couple of apes - nope, it was still there. He scoured the sim for instances of sexual violence, and - yup, immediately avenged.

But this time, the blood feud didn't last. It was as if the apes had reached a new level of understanding. They could still be incredibly violent, but they preferred not to. Not unless someone had hurt someone they loved - and even then, they could eventually rein it in.

Love-motivated violence. Did that satisfy the design brief?

What was the design brief again?

Oh, yeah. Warriors.

Steve sped the sim up and watched for war.

---

A few days later, he spotted a potential war-like situation. Exciting! He paused the sim and invited Gabe and Murdoch into his office.

"Check out these bendy sticks," he said, gesturing at the screen. "They've tied strings to them and use them to launch other sticks around."

"Impressive," said Murdoch. "Have they used them in battle before?"

Steve shook his head. He'd only seen the bendy-stick tribe use their new weapons to hunt.

"Looks complicated," said Gabe. "Error prone. The rock-throwing tribe is going to stomp them."

"I wouldn't be so sure," mused Murdoch. "The bendy-stickers have a huge range advantage. I'd put my money on them."

Steve didn't care to put his money on either tribe. A big part of him was hoping that the apes would negotiate a peaceful resolution. That wasn't the design brief, though.

"You guys ready?" he asked.

Murdoch and Gabe pulled up chairs and stared at the screen.

Steve dragged the speed slider to real-time, and un-paused the sim. "Let's go!" he said.

In less than an hour, Murdoch had been proven right - it had come down to range. Every single male of the rock-throwing tribe had been either killed, or bound, flogged and castrated.

The females were distributed as prizes of war among the victorious males. With no one left to enact violent retribution, the bendy-stick males immediately set about consummating their victory in the blood-soaked streets of the vanquished village.

Steve winced and looked away.

Murdoch stroked his chin thoughtfully. Gabe turned to face him.

"We want to give these things weapons? In our world?"

"That's the idea, yes."

"That's the craziest idea anyone has ever had."

"I've had crazier ones."

"Did neither of you see what I just saw?" Gabe exploded. "These things are killing machines! Completely nuts!" Turning red, he stood up abruptly and marched out of the office, slamming the door behind him.

Steve and Murdoch remained silently at the table.

Steve chewed on his pen. Eventually, he tried to reassure his boss. "Don't worry about him. He'll come around."

"I'm not worried."

"I've got to admit, he does have a point. They're volatile. Giving them weapons up here seems...inadvisable."

Murdoch shrugged. "Steve, just step back for a moment and look at what you've achieved. In the past six months, you've transformed these monkeys from primitive animals to sentient beings who can mass produce weaponry, train in groups, and premeditate and execute battle plans. That's incredible! I get that you feel bad for the rock tribe, but you've got to let it go."

Steve blushed. He still wasn't used to having his work complimented.

Murdoch continued. "Look. Firstly, the rock-throwers had it in for the bendy-stickers anyway. It was kill or be killed. But more importantly - you didn't see a flower-picking tribe, did you?"

Steve shook his head.

"Why do you think that is?"

Steve knew why it was. Any tribe that was not prepared to wage war was immediately wiped off the map by a tribe that was. "So what's your plan for making sure these apes don't turn us into the rock-throwing tribe?" he asked.

"Ah yes, I was getting to that. I have another ask. We need to be able to read their minds."

Steve laughed. Murdoch stared at him, deadpan. Steve stopped laughing. Murdoch was serious.
