## 0. Defender of The State

"Don't feel bad," Sullivan told himself as he drove down the empty streets to the abandoned warehouse district where Filbert's crew had made their headquarters. "They were terrorists."

It was never supposed to get this far. He had expected the kids to wimp out and give up when he'd suggested the bombing. Instead, the little maniacs had seized onto the idea with gusto, and they now threatened the stability of the state. His state. The state that had taken him in decades ago, and provided him not just with food and shelter, but meaning and purpose in life. The state that had made him the man he was today. He'd be damned if he was going to allow a couple of brats from the outlying provinces to ruin it.

He had had no choice. They'd forced his hand. They'd asked for it.

"Strike team, report?" he asked over the radio. He waited a few seconds, but no reply came. Weird.

"Strike team, this is your DONS liason," he clarified. "Please report your status."

Nothing. How annoying. This had been his first time working with this particular Commonwealth Special Forces regiment, and so far, results were less than impressive. He made a mental note to reprimand them later.

His GPS said that he was a mere four minutes from the tracker he'd placed on doomsquad69's van, so he simply followed the blue line on the map and tried not to get too annoyed about the rank insubordination implied by the radio silence.

There was nobody outside the warehouse. The abundant hairs stood up on the back of Sullivan's neck. Insubordination was one thing, but glaring incompetence was even worse. While a far cry from being a special forces tactician, Sullivan nonetheless understood the wisdom of standing guard. If he could figure it out...come on.

Huffy with indignation, Sullivan walked up to the warehouse's side door, twisted the handle, and walked in.

The stench of death hit him before the visuals made their impact. It was the worst thing he'd ever smelled - worse even, than the first week when the lift stations had gone out. He held his shirt over his nose and tried not to gag as he surveyed the scene.

Crumpled bodies lay everwhere. Harold, the idiot he'd convinced to kidnap Stacy II, was sprawled out over the back of a couch, covered in blood and twisted in inhuman ways. Blake, one of the cretins that Filbert had imported from New Australia, had been just about sawed in half by automatic gunfire. Black-clad special forces were strewed around the entire floor of the warehouse, each ripped open with gaping exit wounds. And in the far corner - "oh, shit" he thought.

In the far corner was a small cadre of survivors, among which were Filbert and Stacy II. Three of them were aiming guns at him, and they all looked very, very pissed off.

"Nice of you to join us," Stacy II said as she and Filbert walked towards him. "Say, how did you know where to find us?"

Sullivan swallowed. This was an unexpected development.

"I don't remember telling you where our base was," Filbert chimed in.

"Lucky guess," Sullivan feebly attempted to explain.

Filbert cracked him over the back of his head with his gun and he fell to his knees. Blows rained down upon him and the world went dark.

Sullivan woke up, disoriented, crucified to a shelving rack. His head hurt like he was waking up from a two-bottle-of-scotch hangover, and he was pretty sure one of his ribs was broken.

"How did you find us?" Stacy II asked again, as she cleaned her nails with a railgun projectile.

"You look terrible," he replied to the disheveled young lady in her filthy office attire.

Stacy II scowled. Wordlessly, she aimed the railgun projectile like a dart, and threw it at his hand. It missed, but the one-atom-thick diamond tipped projectile punched through the steel shelving unit like it was made of cork.

"Damn," she said, and picked up another projectile. She handed it to Filbert with a "your turn."

"How did you find us?" Filbert repeated to Sullivan.

Sullivan tried to calm his racing mind and assess the situation. It was pretty bad. Definitely worse than the time they'd hauled him out of the basement and threatened him with digit-swapping surgery. Probably at least on par with the time Xavier had captured him and blamed him for the death of his father, possibly worse. And that time had resulted in solitary confinement and scurvy.

"I work for the Department of National Security!" he blubbered. "You guys were leaving fingerprints everywhere! I came to warn you!"

Filbert's eyes narrowed. "What fingerprints?" he asked.

"Digital stuff," Sullivan bluffed. "It's complicated."

"Try me."

"You know, uh, cookies and stuff. Web searches for 'how to make a bomb.' That sort of thing."

"Doesn't sound that complicated," Filbert responded, annoyed. "And I used a VPN for searching that stuff."

"We back traced the IP address."

"Sounds like bullshit."

Sullivan began to sweat. It was indeed bullshit.

Stacy II, unable to contain herself, butted back in. "How did all these assholes find us?" she asked, gesturing to the black-clad corpses strewn throughout the warehouse. "And if you came to warn us, why didn't you just call us?"

Sullivan opened his mouth to fabricate more plausible-sounding lies, but none came out. Stacy II sensed his moment of hesitation, seized the projectile back off Filbert, and flung it at him. It punctured several inches into his leg and hurt like hell. He gasped in pain.

"And another thing I've been thinking about," Stacy II continued. "What are the chances that Harold and those other two idiots targeted me? There are millions of Commonwealth employees!"

Sullivan bit his tongue. He had to admit, the odds were long.

"And finally," Stacy continued, "I had one more question. Cui bono? Who benefits from a terrifying period of chaos and murder, brought to a relieving close by the tireless efforts of a single national security agent? Hmm?"

Sullivan sighed and hit the back of his head against the shelving unit. In a way, this was a relief. All of her questions had been rhetorical and he didn't have to try to answer them anymore.

"I'm dead, aren't I?" he thought.

"Sure looks that way," responded the voice in his head.

He'd forgotten about the voice. It had been quiet for some time.

"Is there anything you can do?" he asked.

"Tons of stuff," the voice responded. "But I don't particularly feel like it."

"Oh," he thought. "I thought you said I was a man of destiny?"

"You are," came the reply. "But not necessarily in this realm."

"I see," he thought, as Stacy II threw another projectile at him. This one hit him in the torso.

"I guess that's alright then," he thought.

Some of the other survivors joined in the game of darts. It was cathartic for them, he figured. One of the darts hit him in what must have been a major artery, and his blood started squirting out quite violently.

Sullivan began to nod off as the world became fuzzy. This was a painful way to die, but he didn't mind. After all, he was a man of destiny.
