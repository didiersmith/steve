## 0. El Dorado of Probable Cause

"FEDSEC wants a full blueprint for the orbital ring," Murdoch announced to Allen, shutting his office door behind him. "And written explanations of all unusual features, particularly anything that could be used to effect a launch into space."

Allen rubbed his eyes with his hand. "The screws are on to us," he groaned.

Murdoch nodded. "Seems they've figured it out, yeah."

"How long do we have to escape this godforsaken prison planet?"

"They're still poking around for probable cause," Murdoch replied hopefully.

Allen laughed. "So like, a few days? This whole place is the El Dorado of probable cause. The streets are practically paved with damning evidence."

Murdoch chuckled at the reference to a particularly entertaining episode of the Great Meme Competition, before remembering the severity of their predicament.

"Yeah," he said. "A few days sounds right."

Allen straightened up. "Do we have a habitat?"

Murdoch shook his head. "Not quite. Xavier's boys haven't figured out how to grow our plants yet. We can launch, though. And we can build a warship in space. We'll need to bring all our food and air with us and hope to resupply before it runs out."

"Goddamn it," Allen replied. "That's not ideal, is it?"

"No," Murdoch said. "No, it's not."

"Where can we even resupply?" Allen asked. "It's not like there's a gas station on every corner out there."

Murdoch looked at his old friend and rival. Perhaps Allen's brain was even more gone than his. 

"Sirius, obviously" Murdoch answered. "Why do you think I sent those two ahead?"
