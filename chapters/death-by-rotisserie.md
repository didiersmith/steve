## 0. Death by Rotisserie

Fortunately for Stacy II, induction ceremonies were few and far between.

"We're not savages," Curtis explained. "We only eat tyrants, criminals, and unproductive layabouts. They're all in short supply at the moment, so I'm afraid you may have to wait a while before you're allowed to leave."

"Sure," Stacy II responded awkwardly. "No rush. Where do I sleep in the meantime?"

"There's an empty cottage down the street," Curtis offered. "Feel free to make yourself at home!"

Stacy II didn't ask what had happened to the previous inhabitant of the cottage.

She settled in to her new home and got to know her neighbours, curious to learn how they made a living. Given the consequences, she was quite wary of being considered a tyrant, criminal or unproductive layabout. On both sides, the households consisted of a nuclear family with a working father, a stay-at-home-mom, and a small horde of children. Both of the fathers did remote work over the internet - one of them "job stacked" quality assurance for three separate software companies, and the other was a freelance lawyer, specializing in contract drafting and review. The Starlink transceivers, they explained, were smuggled in from overseas.

The lawyer gave her the creeps, so she made friends with the QA guy. He graciously lent her his WiFi password, and she set about finding remote work that matched her skillset. This was harder than she'd anticipated, and after failing to gain any traction as a freelance graphic designer, a digital personal assistant and an AI annotator, she got herself certified as a life coach and targeted depressed, single career women in their mid-to-late 30s. This turned out to be quite a profitable niche. Before long, her days were filled with Zoom calls, listening to women complain about their co-workers in exchange for forty thousand satoshis an hour.

As the months rolled by, she began to suspect that the induction ceremony may never arrive - perhaps the cannibalism was just an almost mythical theoretical backstop, similar to how the Governor General could theoretically dismiss the Prime Minister of Australia but had only ever done so once. She relaxed, coming to believe that the day of "eat or be eaten" would never arrive - until, one evening, she was disturbed by a commotion in the streets.

She opened her door and stepped out onto her porch. Dozens of men, women and children, most of whom she now recognized, were marching in the streets, clanging pots and pans.

She spotted her lawyer neighbour in the crowd. "We've got one!" he shouted at her. "Criminal scum!"

Stacy II watched with interest as the charivari worked its way past her house. She still wasn't sure what it was all about, until she spotted someone in the middle of the crowd that she hadn't seen in quite some time. Hands tied behind his back and surrounded by large, rough-looking men, glumly strode Archibald.

"Archibald!" she yelled out. "Archie!"

Archibald recognized her and shouted something in her direction, but she couldn't make it out over the din. She rushed in to the crowd, and marched with the revelers to the village square, where Curtis was seated behind a table.

The men flanking Archibald dragged him in front of Curtis, kicked him in the back of the knees, and allowed him to fall into the dirt. They stepped back, and Curtis spoke.

"A case!" he exclaimed, joyfully. "It's been a while! Who's prosecuting him?"

A man stepped forward out of the crowd. "I am, your honour."

The crowd cheered.

"Very good!" said Curtis. "What are you prosecuting him for?"

"Theft!"

"I see. And do you have any evidence of this crime?" Curtis asked.

"Yeah! I saw him break into my larder and try to steal some bacon!"

Curtis nodded. "Compelling. Thank you."

He turned to Archibald, who was sitting on the ground, hands still tied behind his back. "Do you have anything to say in your defence?" he asked.

"Yeah, plenty!" Archibald responded. "For starters, I never actually stole any bacon, or anything else for that matter! He interrupted me before I could," he explained, pointing his chin at the prosecutor.

"So you admit you intended to steal from this man?" asked Curtis.

"No!" responded Archibald. "I'm just saying, I couldn't even if I wanted to, because he interrupted me. But I didn't want to. Nu-uh."

"So why were you in my larder?" demanded the prosecutor.

"I was lost," replied Archibald.

"Lost, inside my house, uninvited?"

"I had entered into a fugue state." 

"My front door had been kicked in."

"Fugue states are like that sometimes."

"Enough!" yelled Curtis. "Does anyone else have any testimony they'd like to submit?"

Stacy II stepped forward. "I know this boy!" she shouted. "He's a good kid! He wouldn't knowingly break into someone's larder, that's totally out of character."

"You're acquainted with this thief?" Curtis asked.

"Yes! But-"

"Then your testimony is invalid! Conflict of interest, you see. We can only take testimony from people who don't know him."

"But how are they supposed to-"

"Order!" Curtis shouted, and thumped the table with his fist. "Overruled!" He turned to address Archibald. "Thank you for your testimony. After much deliberation, I find you guilty on all charges!"

A clamour of approval sprang from the crowd. When the shouts and clanging died down, Curtis continued. "I sentence you to death by rotisserie. It will be carried out tomorrow at sunrise. Construct a spit!" he shouted to the crowd, who erupted once more into applause.

When the crowd finally quieted again, he raised his hands and added, "In other news, we will have an induction ceremony tomorrow evening. Bring your uninducted!"

He winked at Stacy II as the crowd went wild.

She couldn't sleep that night. The thought of eating another human being was already bad enough, but for it to be Archibald made it infinitely worse. Although he had been a constant source of annoyance and frustration during their brief acquaintance, she was still moderately fond of him. The kid certainly didn't deserve to be eaten, regardless of whether or not he'd actually tried to steal someone's bacon. When she regained the throne, she'd ban cannibalism.

When she regained the throne. The thought made her face burn with embarrassment. Wasn't that what she was here for? What she'd set out to do? And now, she was about to eat one of her subjects, so that she could continue to live in comfort whilst offering online friendship-as-a-service to lonely, depressed career women.

"Goddamn it," she grumbled, and rolled over in her bed.

A soft knock at the door disturbed her attempted slumber. She ignored it, and it came again, louder.

"Coming," she groaned, and stumbled to the door. She opened it, and Filbert was standing on her porch.

Her skin ran hot with rage. "You absolute vile piece of-"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah," he responded, shoving her aside and entering her cottage. "Glad to see you're alive too."

"I hate you," she hissed.

"Get over it," he responded. "Right now, I'm your best friend in the world. Unless you feel like eating Baldy and completing your conversion to 'irredeemable savage.'"

"How do you know about that?" she asked.

"Archibald told me," he replied. "We had a good chat earlier. His guards are asleep."

Suspicious of the timing, Stacy II put two and two together. "Are you the reason he's here?"

Filbert turned slightly red. "I told him to find you, not go about breaking into houses and stealing their cured meats!"

"You idiot!"

"You relax! I came to rescue him, didn't I? You're both lucky I showed up."

Stacy II kicked him in the shin, and flailed angrily at his face. "Goddamn it Filbert, you are the absolute worst! Everything was fine before! I was never going to have to eat anyone until you came along!"

Attempting to parry her blows, Filbert retorted. "You really believe that? No one else would ever try to steal something? You'd be able to live out your days without ever being inducted into this insane cult?"

Stacy II ceased her attack and broke down in tears. "Obviously not!" she cried. "I'm not a moron. But what was I supposed to do? You left me stranded here! This place is hell, Filbert! You stranded me in hell!"

Filbert reached out his hand to try to comfort her, but she slapped it away. "I hate you!" she yelled.

"Understandable," Filbert replied, "but try to get over it, okay? We've got work to do."

After Filbert managed to figure out the kettle and make her a cup of tea, Stacy II started to feel better. "So what's your plan?" she asked.

"Easy," Filbert responded. "His guards are asleep. Or, at least, they were twenty minutes ago. The plan is, we break him out, I fly him back to his village, then come back and get you, and we leave this godforsaken dump forever."

Stacy II nodded. "Good plan. I never want to see this place again. New Australia is a lost cause. Where are we going?"

"I figured we'd make our way to Antarctica."

"What?"

"I'll explain later."

Stacy II shrugged and changed the subject. "How are you going to break him out?" she asked.

"Do you have any bolt cutters?"

"What do I look like, a bicycle thief?"

Filbert sighed and started opening cupboards. Eventually, he found the cottage's tool chest. There were no bolt cutters, but he was able to fashion something serviceable from a pair of pliers, a couple of pipes, and duct tape.

"Farm engineering," he explained.

"I don't want to hear it," she replied.

******

Archibald was being kept padlocked in a chicken run belonging to the guy whose bacon he had attempted to steal. As hoped, the guards were asleep. Archibald, who was nervously pacing the small pen, lit up as they approached.

"Your Royal Highness! You came! I knew you wouldn't let me be eaten. Sorry about abandoning you back then, I...uh..."

"Save it," Stacy II whispered sharply. "How the hell have you not even prepared an excuse? What have you been doing here?"

"I've, uh..."

"Don't answer that," she interrupted. "It was rhetorical."

Archibald stood back silently as Filbert attacked the padlock with his makeshift bolt cutters. They utterly failed to make a dent in the hardened steel and the pipes quickly tore through the duct tape and slipped off the handles of the pliers.

"Farm engineering, huh?" Stacy II asked quietly.

"Hush, you," Filbert responded, and started clipping through the chicken wire with the pliers.

Stacy II gripped her railgun nervously and watched the guards snore as Filbert worked. They remained fast asleep, despite the jingling and rustling of the chicken wire attempting to roll itself back up.

"Ow!" Filbert complained, under his breath.

Stacy II smacked him and mouthed, "Shut up!"

Filbert showed her his cut hand, and failed to garner any sympathy.

Within a few minutes, the wire mesh had been fully cut from top to bottom, Archibald was free, and the guards were still lightly snoring. Anarcho-Cannibalist society really wasn't well-prepared for keeping prisoners, Stacy II reflected.

Silently, Filbert led the trio to the sports field where the children had been playing soccer when Stacy II had first arrived. The huge wooden gate in the fence was shut, but Cosmo was sitting at the edge of the field, alert and waiting for their return. He wagged his tail with excitement when he caught sight of Stacy II, running across the field.

"Okay, now you stay here while I fly Archibald back home," Filbert told her.

She huddled next to the fence, and tried to conceal herself in the shadows. Filbert and Archibald mounted Cosmo and took to the skies, leaving Stacy II alone and terrified.

She waited, shivering, in the cold silence of the night. After ten or so minutes, a shout rang out from the direction of the chicken run, followed by another, followed by a hubbub of loud, angry voices. Her heart beat furiously - Archibald's escape had been discovered. The sun would be rising soon, which would leave her completely exposed. She could sneak back to her hut, but then what? Her association with Archibald made her his primary suspected accomplice, and the Anarcho-Cannibalist justice system didn't exactly seem to favour innocence until proven guilty. A giant wooden rotisserie had been constructed, someone was going to be roasted, and she was next in line.

The voices got closer. The beams of flashlights played across the sky as the villagers searched for their missing prisoner.

As she huddled against the fence, praying to Steve, Cosmo flew overhead and landed in the field.

"Over there!" she heard a man shout in the distance. "What the hell is that?"

The shouts grew louder as the mob advanced towards the soccer pitch. She sprinted across the grass, and was blinded by a flashlight beam.

"Found them!" someone yelled.

"It's that crazy lady!"

"Get her!"

She ran blindly until the shade of Cosmo's giant body allowed her to recover her eyesight. Looking up, she saw Filbert, leaning towards her with his hand outstretched. She grabbed his hand and vaulted aboard the winged dinosaur. They took off just as the angry crowd reached the field.

"Burn in hell, you freaks!" she shouted as they flew away into the night. As the cold set in and she reflected on her time in New Australia, she wondered if she'd made any impact at all.

Probably not, she decided.
