## 0. Death by Rotisserie

Fortunately for Stacy II, induction ceremonies were few and far between.

"We're not savages," Curtis explained. "We only eat tyrants, criminals, and unproductive layabouts. They're all in short supply at the moment, so I'm afraid you may have to wait a while before you're allowed to leave."

"No rush," Stacy II responded awkwardly. "Where do I sleep in the meantime?"

"There's an empty cottage down the street," Curtis offered. "Feel free to make yourself at home!"

Stacy II thought of asking what had happened to the previous inhabitant of the cottage, but decided to hold her tongue.

She settled in to her new home and got to know her neighbours, curious to learn how the cannibals made a living. In contrast to the hunter-gatherer and raider lifestyles on the rest of New Australia, her new neighbours mostly did remote work over the internet - one of the dads "job stacked" quality assurance for three separate software companies, another was a freelance lawyer, and the moms mostly raised their perfect, beautiful children. They were weirdly, surreally...normal.

The lawyer gave her the creeps, so she made friends with the QA guy. He graciously lent her his WiFi password, and she set about finding remote work that matched her skillset. After failing to gain any traction as a freelance graphic designer and a digital personal assistant, she got certified as a life coach. She targeted depressed, single career women in their mid-to-late 30s, which turned out to be quite a profitable niche. Before long, her days were filled with Zoom calls, listening to women complain about their co-workers in exchange for forty thousand satoshis an hour.

As the months rolled by, Stacy II began to suspect that the induction ceremony may never arrive - perhaps the cannibalism was just an almost mythical theoretical backstop, similar to how the Governor General could theoretically dismiss the Prime Minister of Australia but had only ever done so once. She relaxed, coming to believe that the day of "eat or be eaten" would never arrive - until, one evening, she was disturbed by a commotion in the streets.

She opened her door and stepped out onto her porch. Dozens of men, women and children, most of whom she now recognized, were marching in the streets - clanging pots and pans, and chanting "Yum! Yum! Criminal scum!"

Stacy II watched with interest as the charivari worked its way past her house. She still wasn't sure what it was all about, until she spotted someone in the middle of the crowd that she hadn't seen in quite some time. Hands tied behind his back and surrounded by large, rough-looking men, glumly strode Archibald.

"Archibald!" she yelled out. "Archie!"

Archibald recognized her and shouted something in her direction, but she couldn't make it out over the din. She rushed in to the crowd, and marched with the revelers to the village square, where Curtis was seated behind a table.

The men flanking Archibald dragged him in front of Curtis, kicked him in the back of the knees, and allowed him to fall into the dirt. They stepped back, and Curtis spoke.

"A case!" he exclaimed, joyfully. "It's been a while! Who's prosecuting him?"

A man stepped forward out of the crowd. "I am, your honour."

The crowd cheered.

"Very good!" said Curtis. "What are you prosecuting him for?"

"Theft!"

"I see. And do you have any evidence of this crime?" Curtis asked.

"Yeah! I saw him break into my larder and try to steal some bacon!"

Curtis nodded. "Compelling. Thank you."

He turned to Archibald, who was sitting on the ground, hands still tied behind his back. "Do you have anything to say in your defence?" he asked.

"I didn't steal nothing!" Archibald objected. "He interrupted me before I could," he explained, pointing his chin at the prosecutor.

"So you admit you intended to steal from this man?" asked Curtis.

"Of course not!" responded Archibald. "I'm a law-abiding citizen. I'm just saying, I couldn't even if I wanted to, because he interrupted me. But I didn't want to. Nu-uh."

"So why were you in my larder?" demanded the prosecutor.

"I was lost," replied Archibald.

"Lost, inside my house, uninvited?"

"I had entered into a fugue state." 

"My front door had been kicked in."

"Fugue states are like that sometimes."

"Enough!" yelled Curtis. "Does anyone else have any testimony they'd like to submit?"

Stacy II stepped forward. "I know this boy!" she shouted. "He's a good kid! He wouldn't knowingly break into someone's larder, that's totally out of character."

"You're acquainted with this thief?" Curtis asked.

"Yes! But-"

"Then your testimony is invalid! Conflict of interest, you see. We can only take testimony from people who don't know him."

"But how are they supposed to-"

"Order!" Curtis shouted, and thumped the table with a gavel. "Overruled!" He turned to address Archibald. "Thank you for your testimony. After much deliberation, I find you guilty on all charges!"

A clamour of approval sprang from the crowd. When the shouts and clanging died down, Curtis continued. "I sentence you to death by rotisserie. It will be carried out tomorrow at sunrise. Do you have anything to say for yourself?" he asked Archibald.

Archie shrugged. "Dura lex, sed lex," he said.

"Construct a spit!" Curtis shouted to the crowd, who erupted once more into applause.

When the crowd finally quieted again, he raised his hands and added, "In other news, we will have an induction ceremony tomorrow evening. Bring your uninducted!"

Curtis winked at Stacy II as the crowd went wild.

She couldn't sleep that night. The thought of eating another human being was already bad enough, but for it to be Archibald made it infinitely worse. Although he had been a constant source of annoyance and frustration during their brief acquaintance, she was still moderately fond of him. The kid certainly didn't deserve to be eaten, regardless of whether or not he'd actually tried to steal someone's bacon. When she regained the throne, she'd ban cannibalism.

When she regained the throne. The thought made her face burn with embarrassment. Wasn't that what she was here for? What she'd set out to do? And now, she was about to eat one of her would-be subjects, so that she could continue to live in comfort whilst offering online friendship-as-a-service.

"Goddamn it," she grumbled, and rolled over in her bed.

A soft knock at the door disturbed her attempted slumber. She ignored it, and it came again, louder.

"Coming," she groaned, and stumbled to the door. She opened it, and Filbert was standing on her porch.

Her skin ran hot with rage. "You lily-livered piece of-"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah," he responded, shoving her aside and entering her cottage. "Glad to see you're alive too."

"I hate you," she hissed.

"Get over it," he responded. "Right now, I'm your best friend in the world. Unless you feel like eating Baldy and completing your conversion to 'irredeemable savage.'"

"How do you know about that?" she asked.

"Archibald told me," he replied. "We had a good chat earlier. His guards are asleep."

Suspicious of the timing, Stacy II put two and two together. "Are you the reason he's here?"

Filbert turned slightly red. "I told him to find you, not break into houses and steal their cured meats!"

"You dolt!"

"You relax! I came to rescue him, didn't I? You're both lucky I showed up."

Stacy II kicked him in the shin, and flailed angrily at his face. "Filbert, you imbecile! You lowlife commoner!! Everything was fine before! I was never going to have to eat anyone until you came along!"

Attempting to parry her blows, Filbert retorted. "You really believe that? No one else would ever try to steal something? You'd be able to live out your days without ever being inducted into this insane cult?"

Stacy II ceased her attack and broke down in tears. "Obviously not!" she cried. "I'm not daft. But what was I supposed to do? You left me stranded here! This place is hell, Filbert! You stranded me in hell!"

Filbert reached out his hand to try to comfort her, but she slapped it away. "Hands off the Queen!" she yelled.

"Aren't you going to ask why I came back?" Filbert asked.

Now that Filbert mentioned it, his return was surprisingly uncharacteristic. Had he suddenly grown a spine?

"Why did you come back?" she asked.

"Steve spoke to me. Apparently, if you don't take New Sealand back and get the people back on track, we won't go to Steve when we die."

"Who will we go to?"

Filbert told her.

She flew into another fit of rage.

"I was this close!" she yelled, holding her index finger and thumb a couple of millimeters apart. "Then you had to disobey a direct order, and now we're going to go to that asshole when we die?"

"Listen," Filbert said, holding his hands up. "Water under the bridge, okay? We've got work to do."

After Filbert managed to figure out the kettle and make her a cup of tea, Stacy II started to feel better. "So what's your plan for breaking Archie out?" she asked.

"Easy," Filbert responded. "His guards are asleep. Or, at least, they were twenty minutes ago. The plan is, we break him out."

"Wow, very well thought out."

"And then we leave New Australia forever."

Stacy II nodded. "I never want to see this place again. New Australia is a lost cause. Where are we going?"

"Antarctica."

"What?"

"I'll explain later."

Stacy II shrugged. "What do you need from me?" she asked.

"Do you have any bolt cutters?"

"What do I look like, a bicycle thief?"

Filbert sighed and started opening cupboards. Eventually, he found the cottage's tool chest. There were no bolt cutters, but he was able to fashion something serviceable from a pair of pliers, a couple of pipes, and duct tape.

"Farm engineering," he explained.

"I don't want to hear it," she replied.

---

Archibald was being kept padlocked in a chicken run belonging to the guy whose bacon he had attempted to steal. As hoped, the guards were asleep. Archibald, who was nervously pacing the small pen, lit up as they approached.

"Your Royal Highness! You came! I knew you wouldn't let me be eaten. Sorry about ditching you back before, I...uh..."

"Save it," Stacy II hissed.

Archibald stood back silently as Filbert attacked the padlock with his makeshift bolt cutters. They utterly failed to make a dent in the hardened steel and fell apart almost immediately.

"Farm engineering, huh?" Stacy II asked quietly.

"Hush, you," Filbert responded, and started clipping through the chicken wire with the pliers.

Stacy II gripped her railgun nervously and watched the guards snore as Filbert worked. They remained fast asleep, despite the jingling and rustling of the chicken wire.

"Ow!" Filbert complained, under his breath.

Stacy II smacked him and mouthed, "Shut up!"

Filbert showed her his cut hand, and failed to garner any sympathy.

Within a few minutes, the wire mesh had been fully cut from top to bottom, Archibald was free, and the guards were still lightly snoring. Anarcho-Cannibalist society really wasn't well-prepared for keeping prisoners, Stacy II figured.

Under cover of darkness, the three of them crept down the dirt streets of the Anarcho-Cannibalist village, to the port. As they rounded the corner past her cottage, they ran into her lawyer neighbour.

"Oh hey, Stacy!" he said. His facial expression changed to confusion as he noticed Filbert, and then anger as he saw Archibald.

"Escape!" he yelled. "We've got escapers!"

Stacy II shot him in the chest and the three took off down the street.

Lights turned on as they ran, and people came out of their houses to see what the commotion was. Stacy II sprinted faster than she ever had in her life. Helping Archie escape was probably bad enough to earn her a place on the rotisserie, but shooting her neighbour was a million times worse. They'd probably slow cook her for that.

Panting for breath, they reached the docks. A gunshot rang out. Conventional small arms, like the ones the rebels had used to take the Theocratic Dominion. Stacy II prayed that they'd keep missing as more gunshots followed, and the boat that Xavier and Vincent had built for them materialized out of the darkness.

She dove aboard the boat and huddled down against the bulkhead. Archie followed and Filbert brought up the rear, firing up the engine and casting off.
