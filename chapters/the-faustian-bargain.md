## 0. The Faustian Bargain

Life was good. For the first time since moving to Murdoch Heavy Industries, Steve felt like everything was under control.

His peninsula apes hadn't needed his help. Coming hot off centuries of war on the peninsula, it had only taken six hundred of them to defeat an empire of millions on the other side of the planet. Survivors had been converted. The meme was unquestionably dominant - Steve and Gabe topped the leaderboard, and it wasn't even close.

At this rate, they'd have the debt paid off in no time. What had Gabe been worried about? Steve booked himself in for a weekend at a spa resort and took a well-deserved weekend off.

"Go on, my little islanders," Murdoch said, watching a crew guide a ship out of a harbour. "Venture forth and conquer!"

He watched as ship after ship of his islanders sailed across the oceans to every corner of the planet. How were they ever supposed to unleash their full creative potential, cramped on a tiny island? Ridiculous. No, what they needed was an empire. A global, individualist empire. A true testament to the power and righteousness of his brilliant meme.

Murdoch's stomach grumbled. He hadn't eaten since the board meeting. The board of directors hadn't reacted particularly well to the financial report. Perhaps he should have goosed the numbers a bit. One particularly mutinous shareholder was even making noises about taking corrective measures.

Feckin' shareholders. If he got voted out...Murdoch shuddered. Not only would his plan be over, but his life as he knew it. Who was Murdoch without Murdoch Heavy Industries?

Well, life as he knew it was ending anyway. One way or another, this would be his final fiscal quarter as CEO of MHI. It was now or never. Do or die.

Feckin' islanders better pull through.

Steve had cockily left StevieNix running at a pretty fast clip while he was on holiday, so decades elapsed while Murdoch ventured forth to the microwave to heat up some chicken tikka masala. By the time he returned, the islanders had conquered half the continent and had invented...trains?

Murdoch scrolled around the sim, following the tracks that had been carved across vast plains, deserts, and mountain ranges. Steam-powered locomotives hauled long chains of cars behind them, carrying goods, apes, animals..., yup, there was no other word for it. Trains. Good on 'em.

This might actually work.

Murdoch slowly worked away at his chicken tikka masala as he watched the islander apes dissect and optimize every aspect of their existence. It was really quite a sight.

Not a single aspect of their existence was spared from the innovations of hungry tinkerers and their wealthy backers, gagging for the opportunity to ease the apes' burdens in exchange for their money. From crossing the continents to wiping their arses, every moment of every day was sliced, diced, analyzed and optimized for inefficiencies that may be profitably reduced by goods and services.

The quality of life in islander society improved so rapidly that the common ape in one generation enjoyed luxuries unimaginable to the richest apes of two generations past. Apes began to congregate in huge cities, fed by industrialized supply chains stretching around the world, shuttled around by engines - first powered by steam, then internal combustion, and finally jets and electricity.

Once again, Murdoch stayed up all night. Occasionally inspiring a player to place a circuit here, or a financial bet there, he coaxed the islanders into inventing boolean algebra, the transistor, the nuclear reactor. Feck, they were good.

Just a couple more leaps and they'd be caught up. Then, the real work would begin.
