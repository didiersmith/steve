## 0. The Faustian Bargain

"Looks like they didn't need our help", remarked Gabe.

Steve laughed. Six hundred of his hot-blooded peninsula apes had just defeated an empire of millions on the other side of the planet. He wasn't even sure who they had been aligned with. From what he'd seen, it had been an absolutely unhinged meme involving industrial scale ape sacrifice. Good riddance.

With very little encouragement, Steve and Gabe's apes set about converting their new subjects to Steve's alignment meme. "Look at them go!" beamed Steve.

"This is so much easier than that peninsula war" agreed Gabe. "Hopefully the Dysoners fall over as easily as these idiots."

"Be nice!" Steve reminded him. "Our guys got steamrolled too, remember? Sometimes, it just isn't your day."

Gabe nodded and changed the subject. "Looks like your gamble is paying off" he said, pointing to the credit counter. It was ticking upwards, at the fastest rate they'd ever seen.

"Yup, we'll have that debt paid off in no time!" Steve gloated.

They drank a toast to their success and settled in to watch the fun. Over the next sim century, with only a small amount of divine assistance, the peninsula apes conquered and converted a huge fraction of the new continent.

Then, the islanders decided to join the fun. That's when things started, ever so slightly, to derail.

While the peninsula apes had performed their conquest with dual motives - economic gain and religious fervour - the islanders largely cared only about the former. While the islanders were adherents to Steve's meme, they made very little effort to convert anyone else. They limited their interactions with other people to either trades or ethnic cleansing.

In short order, the islander apes controlled a quarter of the world's land mass.

Unprecedenced prosperity flowed from the islanders' vast colonies, but rather than spend the accumulated capital glorifying Steve, the islanders could not help but invest it. Capital begat innovation, which in turn begat capital. The pace of technological improvement exploded.

Not a single aspect of an islander ape's existence was spared from the innovations of hungry tinkerers and their wealthy backers, gagging for the opportunity to ease the ape's burdens in exchange for their money. From fertilizing the fields and crossing the continents to cleaning themselves post-defecation, every moment of every day was sliced, diced, analyzed and optimized for inefficiencies that may be profitably reduced by goods and services.

The quality of life in islander society improved so rapidly that the common ape in one generation enjoyed luxuries unimaginable to the richest apes of two generations past. Apes began to congregate in huge cities, fed by industrialized supply chains stretching around the world, shuttled around by engines - first powered by steam, then internal combustion, and finally jets and electricity. The technologies and the individualist meme spread throughout the world, to societies the islanders had never even heard of.

With the industrial revolution, came a population boom. In a few short centuries, the number of apes in StevieNix increased tenfold. The sim slowed down. Glitches began to appear. Steve found himself spending so much time adding hardware and fixing scaling issues, that he had no time left to monitor the status of his meme.

It was only when a very distressed Gabe came to find him in the datacenter that he learned anything had gone wrong.

"What's up?" he asked, looking up from the MHI-10 he was replacing.

"They've stopped believing", responded Gabe. "We can't make the loan repayments. Default provisions are kicking in."
