# 0. God, why have you forsaken me?

Stacy was twenty-two years old when her mother died of cancer. Witnessing her slow deterioration and painful demise was the hardest thing she'd ever encountered. It wasn't just the grief of watching her mother die that tore her apart - it was the helplessness, the feeling of abandonment. Where was God?

Unable to confess her crisis of faith to anyone she knew, she poured her entire heart into a four-thousand word post on an anonymous forum.

She wrote about her childhood. Her family, how her mother had married a pastor and raised seven kids. She wrote about her accident - the car crash when she was twelve, the paralysis, the surgeries, the miraculous faith healing.

She wrote about the cancer. How often they'd prayed together, how much her poor mother had suffered. Why hadn't the prayer worked?

Why had her God forsaken her?

Her heartfelt stream of consciousness received a single reply, from Russ99.

> Lol, god isn't real, idiot. And even if he was, what makes you think he'd care about your problems? Dude's probably got a lot going on.
