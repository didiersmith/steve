Half an hour later, Murdoch was starting to regret his decision to enlist the help of the two professors. His attempt at exhortation had been immediately derailed straight back to the Call vs Knock debate which he had interrupted. The momentary shock of the world's greatest titan of industry showing up to recruit Steve and Gabe had vanished in the face of the opportunity to enhance the positions of their respective hobby-horses in front of an enlarged audience.

"All I'm saying", Steve droned passionately in a way only a seasoned university professor could achieve, "is that collaboration best happens in person. If we really want to make the most-"

"That's enough!" interrupted Murdoch. "Don't either of you understand game theory? Let's assume that ninety-nine percent of the Dysoners are the la-la-kumbaya care bears you lot think they are. It doesn't matter! Think about the other one percent. In any situation where two or more people collaborate, a prisoner's dilemma opens up. A ecological niche, for psychos and sociopaths to exploit the collaboration of everyone else while either contributing nothing or actively undermining them. Collaboration creates sociopathic predators. It's a fundamental law of the universe, like F equals m a."

Steve and Gabe stared blankly at their irate guest as he continued his monologue.

"Think about it. Why do you pay for things at the store? Why don't you just steal whatever you want? Wait - don't answer that question, you obviously don't steal things because you, along with just about everyone else on this planet, are a couple of effete, ineffectual compliance artists who would chase the shopowner down to throw money at him if he left the store unattended. But think about the remaining one percent. Why don't they just steal whatever they want?"

The thought had never occurred to Steve and Gabe. Obviously, on a macro level, the answer to "why pay for things?" was "because if everyone didn't pay for things, no one would provide them". But on an individual level?

"Violent retribution", answered Murdoch, furiously tapping the table with his finger. "The threat of violent retribution is the solution to the prisoner's dilemma. It is the lynchpin of collaboration, the cornerstone upon which all civilization is built."

Steve thought immediately of the collaborative open-source community surrounding StevieNix, and almost started laughing at the idea of enacting violent retribution against people who submitted substandard pull requests.

"And before you start going on about your open-source ethos", continued Murdoch pointedly, "realize that it's not the same. Sim planets are an infinite resource. Real life planets made of dirt and carbon and whatever else are not. You've already acquiesced to the socially maladjusted by giving them StevieNix for free, but there's a limit to how much damage they can do to the rest of us. Up here, in real life, there's no such limit. Especially when it comes to politics! Where do you think the one percent of sociopaths hang out? Are we going to be dealing with the hippy dippy Dysoner care bears, or the ruthless sociopaths who climbed to the top of their alien power structure?"

He paused for breath, and continued his rant. "Bottom line, if you want to trade with someone, especially someone you don't know, you'd better have someone willing to back you up with the tools of the inquisition or you'll find yourself and your entire civilization penniless, face-down in a canal."

The last part went a bit over their heads, but Steve and Gabe got the general gist of his argument. "So you're saying", Steve attempted to paraphrase, "that the only way we can collaborate with the Dysoners is if we have the technology to hurt them?"

"Not just hurt them", responded Murdoch, "but to destroy them. To annihilate their civilization so thoroughly that not one alien heart is left beating, not one building left standing, not one molecule left fused together. And even then, it won't be enough. The means alone are insufficient - what we really need is the will. We need absolute merciless killers - people who are actually unhinged enough to go through with it. Only then, would the threat be credible."

Steve and Gabe looked at each other. "So you came to...us?"

Murdoch sighed. "Yes, and honestly it's beginning to seem like that was an outrageously stupid idea. But here's the problem. Building the technology is hard enough, but where are we going to find the killers? Outside of a few people in government and a handful of us old-timers, we've done gone and eradicated all the genes for the exact personality traits we need. Aggression. Ambition. Absolutely psychotic lunacy. Of the five hundred million people alive, I bet there are less than a thousand who could do what would need to be done, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a single one - it's not exactly something you'd tick off on a survey?"

Gabe laughed. "How willing are you to destroy an entire alien race? Very willing, willing..."

Steve nodded. "Right, and I can't imagine the 'violent killer breeding program' would gain much popular support."

Murdoch smiled. At last, he was getting through to them. "Exactly. Hope you enjoyed your hundred thousand years' peace everyone, now let's bring back the psychotic murderers."

"So what do you propose?" asked Steve.

Murdoch pointed his chin towards the StevieNix rat's nest, humming in the corner. "How's the AI in your sim coming along, Steve?"
