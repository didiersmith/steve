## 0. Traffic Law Humiliation Rituals

Steve watched resource usage on the MHI-10 spike. Roommate Russ was doing something. He had to give the guy some credit - for an idiot who believed he evolved randomly from soup, he was kinda smart. The MHI-10 was not an easy computer to program - Steve, more than anyone, could appreciate that.

He looked around his office for Gabe, before remembering that he wasn't there. Annoying. He missed having someone to talk to. Gabe, for all his faults, had been his 'someone to talk to' for a thousand years. Not having him around was weird. Maybe he'd bug Murdoch later instead.

What did this mean for the prize money, he wondered. Would he still split it with Gabe? Probably, yeah. But definitely not 50:50.

He hummed a little and turned back to the sim. It looked like Roommate Russ and Murdoch's islander had finally decided to leave their house. About time.

The Balmoral Hotel was a venerable institution in the neighbourhood of East Victoria Park. It occupied a stately old two-storey building with a wrap-around veranda, a patio, and a beer garden. It was surrounded by hedges and a wrought iron fence, and adorned with corgis of various designs. Inside, the slightly-too-slick menus, slightly-too-clean atmosphere, and slightly-too-polished staff betrayed it for what it was - one of several hundred "local" pubs owned and operated by the nationwide Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group. Fortunately for ALH Group, the minor shame of drinking at a chain restaurant was vastly overshadowed in the minds of the public by the convenience of walking-distance beer on tap. The many regulars kept the trade roaring, seven nights a week.

"Let's split up," Russell suggested as they passed by the concrete corgis at the front gate. "I'll check the beer garden."

"Sounds good," Vincent said, grinning. "I'll check the bar. See if she's hiding behind the taps."

Russell sighed. Vincent didn't intend to to check anything. He intended to order a pint. Guess he reckoned he'd earned it, after his long week of not helping at all. Mechanical engineers, man. What were they even good for?

They walked through the door together, and Russell's senses were immediately assaulted with the noise of drunken revelers and the smell of decades' worth of beer, dried so deeply in the floorboards that not even ALH's strongest cleaning chemicals could remove the scent. He didn't much like the Balmoral.

He split off towards the beer garden, and-

"Hey Stacy!" Vincent's voice rang out over the din.

His roommate was waving at the bar. And at the bar, was - oh. Stacy, wearing a Balmoral-branded apon and a ponytail, behind the taps.

Well then.

She spotted the pair, shrieked, and dropped the pint glass she was filling. The pub went silent as the punters stopped their conversations and craned their necks to spot the source of the disturbance. Stacy didn't seem to care, and ran out from behind the bar to wrap Russell in a tight embrace. She stank of beer.

"I can't believe it's really you!" she whispered, before releasing Russell and moving on to give Vincent the same treatment. "I thought it was a dream!"

Vincent shot Russell a "what do we do now?" look over her shoulder. Russell had no idea how to respond. He hadn't planned this far ahead. A beer-bellied man in his early thirties in a high-viz vest walked up to Stacy as she persisted in her hug, and tapped her arm.

"Excuse me, miss," he said. "But you dropped my one-fifty lashes."

"Pour it yourself!" she snapped, releasing Vincent and tearing off her apron. She threw the uniform at the foot of the innocent patron, grabbed Russell's arm, and marched him and Vincent out of the pub. "Let the dead bury their own dead!" she shouted as they left.

Well, she was clearly insane. He hoped the management of the Balmoral wouldn't associate them with her in the future.

They walked down the strip. Russell wanted to go home. It had been a long week. He'd been lured out by the promise of a pint in the beer garden, and that clearly wasn't happening. The crazy lady dragged him into one of the seven proximate bubble tea establishments, instead.

A minute later, he and the other two were seated around a table, surrounded by Mandarin-speaking international students, nursing large cups of artificial creamer mixed with aspartame and "tea." He took a sip from the oversized straw and a tapioca pearl hit him in the roof of his mouth before getting stuck in his teeth.

Awful.

Stacy unloaded. As she explained her weird theories about how Steve's revelations lined up with various bible passages, Russell realized why she sounded crazy - she hadn't had anyone to talk to about the dream.

"So anyway," she concluded after her long explanation, "it all makes perfect sense. Steve's done his work, now it's our turn. Get the people back to breeding and believing."

---

Breeding and believing. How hard could that be?

Turns out, very hard. The three of them didn't agree on the plan. They barely agreed on the problem. Why did Steve pick the three of them again?

"We need to force people into 'alignment,'" Stacy said, putting air quotes around Steve's preferred terminology. "From the moment they're born. Then, they'll do whatever Steve wants, reproduction included."

"So your plan is to brainwash children?" Russell asked.

"It's not brainwashing if it's true! It's 'education.'"

"Right. So your plan is to 'educate' children?"

Stacy shook her head. "It's a good, but it's not enough. If the rest of society is secular, the kids just stop believing when they become adults. We need a whole-of-society solution."

Well, at least she was right about that. How many formerly devout believers had he met, whose piety vanished the moment they went off to uni? More than a few.

"What's your whole-of-society solution?" Vincent asked.

"Simple. We set up a theocratic dictatorship with the death penalty for apostasy."

Russell choked on his bubble tea in laughter. It was a good joke. Then, he noticed her deadpan expression. She wasn't joking.

"Also," she added, "we need to ban weird chemicals. They mess up people's hormones and make them infertile."

"No," Vincent objected. "We're not doing that. Either of those things."

"Agreed," Russell added. "That's insane."

Stacy stuck her tongue out at them both. "The chemicals also cause cancer," she added. "I'm sure that doesn't help birth rates either."

Vincent put his bubble tea down on the table and cleared the area in front of him. Oh boy, here we go. He was getting ready for one of his rants.

"Aside from the obvious moral and logistical problems," he started, "forcing people into alignment is missing the point. Steve gave us free will. He wants us to choose alignment for ourselves."

"No one chooses that!" Stacy objected. "People choose to watch the footy and harass me at the pub. No one chooses to worship God and make babies!"

"Because they don't have a free choice!" Vincent took a familiar deep breath and Russell braced himself for monologue-o-clock. Which rant would he go for?

"People don't get to choose _anything_ anymore," Vincent said. "We live in such a coddled society that our spirits are broken. Why do we need God? We have something more powerful than God. Sorry, Steve, you're obsolete. We have the _government_. The government keeps us safe!"

So far, pretty standard rant. All of Vincent's rants started with the government. But as for which particular aspect he'd pick on today...

"Why would anyone have kids? Kids are _dangerous_. They're _scary_! Anything could go wrong! Are you really surprised that people who are too scared to run a red light are also reluctant to take on the objectively greater risks of childbirth and rearing?"

There it was - traffic laws. Russell had heard this one a dozen times before. It was one of his favourites. He knew exactly what to say to really get his roommate going. "Traffic laws save lives, Vincent."

"Traffic laws!" Vincent exploded. "Traffic laws are a humiliation ritual! They're the surest sign that we are a conquered people! You can't go over a certain speed or the government will throw you in jail? And if you resist arrest, they'll shoot you? What the hell! Of course our society is committing suicide. Total societal death is preferable to living under these conditions!"

Success. Russell leaned back in his chair and sipped his bubble tea, smirking.

"So what's your plan?" Stacy asked. "Destroy the government? Remove all the traffic laws and suddenly people will become devout and prolific?"

Vincent grinned. "I've actually thought about this for a long time."

Russell chuckled quietly as Vincent pitched his ridiculous plan. He stayed out of the debate - he had his own theories, and they were way simpler than Vincent's. People didn't have kids because they couldn't afford them, and they didn't believe in God because the whole idea was stupid. Give them enough free money and a better holy book, and Steve's soul-production machine would be humming just fine again.

Vincent's pitch went on for fifteen minutes. Every time Russell thought he was done, he took a breath and added a new, even more absurd dimension. His plan was composed of far-fetched utopian dreams layered on top of scientifically implausible leaps in technology. It would never work, but it sure was funny.

As he listened to Vincent lay out his elaborate scheme, an idea occurred to Russell. Vincent may have idiodic ideas about human societies, but he was an incredibly talented mechanical engineer. If he could invent even half of the technology he was talking about...Well, Russell could piggyback off his progress to fix the social stuff. No bloodshed, no overthrowing the government. Just a happy, free, post-scarcity society.

"Sounds good," he interrupted. "Let's do it."

Stacy's jaw dropped and she stared at him, astonished.

"Really?" Vincent asked.

"Really," Russell said. "It's foolproof. Let's go for it."

Vincent narrowed his eyes in suspicion, but said nothing. Stacy also looked skeptical. Russell shrugged and drank the last of his bubble tea.

"What did you just agree to?" Steve's voice asked in his head. "I lost track."

"Don't worry about it," he thought in response. "I got you."
