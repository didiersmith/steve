## 0. Traffic Law Humiliation Rituals

Steve watched resource usage on the MHI-10 spike. Roommate Russ was doing something. He had to give the guy some credit - for an idiot who believed he evolved randomly from soup, he was kinda smart. The MHI-10 was not an easy computer to program.

He looked around his office for Gabe, before remembering that he wasn't there. Annoying. He missed having someone to talk to. Gabe, for all his faults, had been his 'someone to talk to' for a thousand years. Not having him around was weird. Maybe he'd bug Murdoch later instead.

He sighed and turned back to the sim. It looked like Roommate Russ and Murdoch's islander had finally decided to leave their house. About damn time.

The Balmoral Hotel was a venerable institution in the neighbourhood of East Victoria Park. It occupied a stately old two-storey building with a wrap-around veranda, a patio, and a beer garden. It was surrounded by hedges and a wrought iron fence, and adorned with corgis of various designs. Inside, the slightly-too-slick menus, slightly-too-clean atmosphere, and slightly-too-polished staff betrayed it for what it was - one of several hundred "local" pubs owned and operated by the nationwide Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group. Fortunately for ALH Group, the minor shame of drinking at a chain restaurant was vastly overshadowed in the minds of the public by the convenience of walking-distance beer on tap. The many regulars kept the trade roaring, seven nights a week.

Russell walked with Vincent down to the pub, past the concrete corgis at the front gate, and in through the door. Their plan had been to split up and search for Stacy separately, but that proved unnecessary - they immediately spotted her behind the bar, pouring a pint of One Fifty Lashes. Vincent elbowed his way up to the bar and Russell followed, to grumbles of disapproval from the punters who'd gotten there first.

Stacy finished pouring the pint, and in the process of reaching over to place it on the bar, glanced at Russell and locked eyes with him. She froze, and looked around. Catching sight of Vincent, she dropped the pint glass and shrieked.

"I can't believe it's really you!" Stacy cried, running around the bar and wrapping the two young men in an embrace. "I thought it was all a crazy dream!"

She held on for several seconds before being interrupted by an "Excuse me, miss" from the punter whose beer she had just dropped all over the bar.

"Piss off!" she offered in response. She tore off her Balmoral-branded apron, threw it at the foot of the offending patron, and marched Russell and Vincent out of the pub. "Let the dead bury their own dead!" she shouted as she left.

The reference went over Russell's head. He felt a pang of regret at having gone to all this effort to track down a woman who was clearly insane, but it abated upon realizing that it hadn't actually been much effort at all.

As they were no longer welcome at the only pub in town, the trio were forced to go to one of the seven proximate bubble tea establishments instead. Within a few minutes, they were seated around a table - surrounded by Mandarin-speaking international students, nursing large cups of artificial creamer mixed with aspartame and "tea".

Stacy unloaded. As she explained her weird esoteric theories about how Steve's revelations lined up with various bible passages, Russell could tell she hadn't had anyone to talk to about the dream. He was grateful for the apparent respect for their privacy displayed by the other occupants of the bubble tea shop, who didn't seem to mind the presence of someone whom - had he not shared the exact same dream - he would have labelled as an unmedicated schizophrenic.

"And then he gave you a card!" she concluded. "What did it say?"

It was Russell's turn to sound like a lunatic. He explained that the card contained an address, which allowed him to access an unfathomably powerful computer that seemed to contain the state of the universe itself. Skipping reluctantly over the boring details surrounding the FORTRAN compiler, he explained that he'd spent the week making an omniscient AI chatbot. The chatbot had tracked her down.

Stacy blinked for a bit as she processed this.

"You turned God into a chatbot?" she asked.

"No," he replied. "God's still God. Or, should I say, Steve. I don't actually know what he's up to these days."

"I'm right here," Steve's voice appeared in his head.

"What the _hell_?" Russell exclaimed, dropping his bubble tea. The other two, along with many of the other patrons of the shop, gave him a confused look.

"Chill out," said Steve. "I'll try not to bother you too much. Anyway, remember what I wanted you to do! Spread the meme. Get people to reproduce. Aligned, useful interstellar warriors. Chop chop, please."

Russell froze. Was he imagining the voice?

Vincent prodded him. "Russ, you okay?" he asked.

Russell waited for the voice to return. It didn't. Eventually, he spoke again.

"Yeah," he said. "I think Steve just said something into my brain."

Stacy laughed. "Duh! He does that all the time."

Vincent agreed. "Yup! He sounds different than he did in the diner though, doesn't he?"

Stacy cocked her neck and gave him a confused look.

"Sounded the same to me," Russell said.

Vincent shrugged.

"Anyway," Russell said. "Steve wants us to get to work."

"And get people back to breeding and believing?" Stacy asked.

Russell nodded. It sounded so stupid. "That's right," he said. "Breeding and believing."

It immediately became apparent that the three of them had vastly different diagnoses for the twin crises of faith and reproduction that gripped their society.

"You just have to force people to believe," Stacy said. "From the time they're toddlers. Then they'll be so aligned that they'll do whatever Steve wants. Reproduction included."

"So your plan is to brainwash children?" Russell asked.

"It's not brainwashing if it's true!" Stacy objected. "But anyway - no. Brainwashing children isn't enough. If the rest of society is secular, the kids just stop believing when they become adults. We need a whole-of-society solution."

"What's your whole-of-society solution?" Vincent asked.

"Simple," the bubbly ex-barmaid replied. "A theocratic dictatorship with the death penalty for apostasy."

Russell laughed at her joke, before realizing she was serious.

"Also," she added, "we need to ban weird chemicals. They mess up people's hormones and make them infertile."

"No," Vincent objected. "We're not doing that. Either of those things."

Stacy stuck her tongue out at him. "They also cause cancer," she added.

"Aside from the obvious moral and logistical problems," Vincent said, "forcing people into alignment is missing the point entirely. Steve gave us free will. He wants us to choose alignment for ourselves."

"We tried that!" Stacy said. "People don't choose that! People choose to watch the footy and harass me at the pub. No one chooses to worship God and make babies."

"Because they don't have a free choice!" Vincent shot back. He took a deep breath and Russell braced himself. Vincent was gearing up for one of his rants.

"People don't get to choose _anything_ anymore," Vincent explained. "We live in such a suffocating mass society that our spirits are broken. Why do we need God? We have something more powerful than God. Sorry, Steve, you're obsolete. We have the _government_."

Stacy rolled her eyes and Vincent continued his rant. "Why would anyone have kids? Kids are _dangerous_. You might die in childbirth! Are you really all that surprised that a society of people too scared to drive through a red light are also too scared to make babies?"

Russell had heard variations on this rant many times before. He knew exactly what to say to really get Vincent going. "Traffic laws keep people safe, Vincent" he said.

"Traffic laws!" Vincent exploded. "Traffic laws are a humiliation ritual! They're the surest sign that we are a conquered people! You can't go over a certain speed or the government will throw you in jail? And if you resist arrest, they'll shoot you? What the hell! Of course our society is committing suicide. Total societal death is preferable to living under these conditions!"

Russell buried his face in his arms.

"So what's your plan?" Stacy asked. "Destroy the government? Remove all the traffic laws and suddenly people will become devout and prolific?"

Vincent grinned. "I've actually thought about this for a long time."

Russell sighed as Vincent pitched his idea. He stayed out of the debate - he had his own theories, and they were way simpler. People didn't have kids because they couldn't afford them, and they didn't believe in God because the whole idea was ridiculous. Give them enough free money and a better holy book, and Steve's soul-production machine would be humming just fine again.

Vincent's pitch went on for fifteen minutes. Every time Russell thought he was done, he took a breath and added a new, even more ridiculous dimension. His plan was composed of far-fetched utopian dreams layered on top of scientifically implausile leaps in technology. It would never work.

As he listened to Vincent's schizo rant, an idea occurred to Russell. Vincent may have stupid ideas about human societies, but he was an incredibly talented mechanical engineer. If he could pull off even half of the technological feats he was talking about, Russell could piggyback off his progress to fix the social stuff. No bloodshed, no overthrowing the government. Just a happy, free, post-scarcity society.

"Sounds good," he interrupted. "Let's do it."

Stacy's jaw dropped.

"Really?" Vincent asked, similarly astonished.

"What did you just agree to?" Steve's voice asked in his head. "I lost track."

"Don't worry about it," he thought in response. "I got you."
