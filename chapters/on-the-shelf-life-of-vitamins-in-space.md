## 0. On the Shelf Life of Vitamins in Space

The battle raged in the background. Murdoch sighed. The timeline had been compressed way more than he'd hoped for, resulting in many cut corners. Hopefully, nothing lethal.

Despite the scheduling adjustments, Murdoch was beyond pleased with how the project had played out. Not to mention, excited! Today was the day. Come hell or high water, his hundred-thousand-year imprisonment was finally over. In a few hours, he would either be free, or dead.

A bomb went off somewhere close to the building. The whiskey in his glass sloshed a little. It was time to get cracking - just one thing left to take care of.

"Are you all packed?" he asked Allen, who was sitting across from him in his office.

"Almost," Allen replied. "Just a couple things to take care of. Are we all going in the launch vehicle together?"

"Yes," Murdoch replied. "Vincent only built one launch vehicle. It's all ready - food, water, StevieNix."

"Hmm," Allen said. "Isn't that a single point of failure?"

Murdoch narrowed his eyes.

"We can't exactly split ourselves in half, can we?"

"I don't like it."

"There's no time to build another vehicle. Either you get in the single point of failure, or you stay on Elba forever."

Allen tutted. "Once we get to space, we should split up. Two warships. No single points of failure."

"Fine, whatever. What do you need to pack?"

Allen, annoyingly, wouldn't drop the subject.

"We should split StevieNix up," he said. "Once we get to space. One half in each warship."

"Planets don't split in half."

"But space does," Allen replied. "We've already split it, remember? There's the CORP and the rest. I'll take the CORP."

Ah, feck. Murdoch realized what was happening.

His plan had been perfect. The particle computers, StevieNix, the islanders, the monkeybots, the orbital ring, the warships. Everything had come together. Near flawless execution. And naw, two hours before launch, he realized that he'd made the classic error: He hadn't planned all the way to the end.

He hadn't planned for this goddamned snake to stab him in the back at the last possible moment.

"The CORP is a big responsibility," he said. "These islanders are hard to manage. Why don't you take the rest of StevieNix? Your aligned souls too. I'll take the CORP."

Murdoch and Allen stared into each others' eyes, silently. Murdoch played through the scenario in his head, trying to figure out how to win. Allen, presumably, was doing the same. Murdoch wondered how long ago Allen had realized that aligned and useful souls, while useful, weren't the prize. The real jewel in the StevieNix crown was the technological innovation pouring out of the Cube of Realistic Physics.

"You can keep Vincent," Allen offered.

"I'm keeping Vincent and the CORP," Murdoch insisted.

"You can keep Steve."

"Damn right I'm keeping Steve. Doesn't change the fact that the CORP is mine."

Allen paused a little, as if he was considering his next move carefully. "I need the CORP," he explained slowly, "to make sure Eternal Spring's technology works in space. We wouldn't want to run out of vitamins, would we?"

Feck. Murdoch gritted his teeth. He was fecked. In all the situations he'd just played out, the only ones where he came out ahead were the ones in which Allen had the honour not to go there.

If Allen was willing to sink so low, there was nothing he could do.

"Why don't you just make all the vitamins beforehand?" he asked in futility. "We're gonna have much bigger problems storing food."

Allen shook his head. "Can't. They'll expire. Really short shelf life."

Allen really was going there. The vitamin expiry date was obviously made up. It didn't matter, the message was clear. Allen had him by the balls, and was willing to saw them off with a rusty butter knife if it meant getting the CORP.

He'd really hoped that the bastard would have some respect for the man who had made it all possible. But alas. That just wasn't in his nature.

"Fine," Murdoch finally conceded. "You take the goddamn CORP. Get Xavier to build your zero-g vitamin factory or whatever. But as soon as we dock at Sirius, you give it right back. I'll have Steve build an independent StevieNix for you in the meantime."

"Of course," Allen smiled. "Sounds like a great plan."

"We launch in two hours. Be packed."

"Will do!" Allen nodded cheerfully. "Oh yeah, I need one more thing."

Murdoch glared at him. "What's that?" he asked.

"I need a monkeybot," Allen said. "To help me run the CORP."

"You're not having Vincent," Murdoch reiterated. "He's mine."

"That's okay," Allen said. "I had someone else in mind. Is it okay if I go down to the monkeybot factory and drop in a soul?"

"Whatever," Murdoch said, slumping back into his chair. "Just make sure they're not absolutely unhinged."

Allen laughed as he walked towards the door. "They're all unhinged, Declan. That was the entire point."

After Allen left and closed the door, Murdoch buried his face in his hands.

What a fecking embarrassment.

Eventually, he got up, grabbed a duffel bag from his closet, and began packing the contents of his extensive liquor cabinet.
