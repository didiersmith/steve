# 58. Von Neumann Paperclip Factory

"You're twenty thousand years old?" Stacy asked, incredulously. "How long is a year?"

"Three hundred and sixty five days, just like yours," Gabe responded.

Stacy was shellshocked. She sat back in her armchair and cradled her white vienna coffee, looking around silently at the other patrons of the extremely hip cafe/bookstore/bicycle repair shop that she and Gabe had fallen into the habit of visiting.

"I'm not even particularly old," Gabe continued. "Steve is around the same age. We have some colleagues who are forty thousand years old. And of course, there are Murdoch and Allen."

"How old are Murdoch and Allen?" Stacy asked.

"I'm not sure that anyone's ever asked them. But over a hundred thousand years, both of them. They were both born before the Great Peace."

Dozens of questions lit up the circuits of Stacy's artificial brain. In the end, she picked one. "What is the Great Peace?" she asked.

Gabe gestured around him. "That would be like me asking you, 'What is civilization?' It's everything. The way we interact with each other, the way our society is ordered, the way we even have a society at all!"

Stacy nodded. "And it's called the Great Peace because you don't kill each other?"

Gabe smiled. "That's right! Homicide was a cornerstone of the barbarian ages, just like it is in StevieNix. Thankfully, we've evolved past it."

"What happens if someone does kill someone?"

"They'd be executed."

Stacy smiled. Finally, some familiar territory.

"And if they steal?"

"Executed."

"What if they criticize the Great Peace?"

The colour drained from Gabe's face and he lowered his voice. "Keep it down," he cautioned her. "You're asking to be executed."

Stacy nodded, sipped her coffee, and looked around the shop as she pondered her newfound knowledge. The bicycle repair person was adjusting the derailleur on a bike, causing quite a racket as he turned the pedals and shifted through the gears. Challenging conditions for an eavesdropper. Still, she decided to change the subject. "Do you ever think about having kids?" she asked.

Gabe shrugged and moved his head noncommittally from side to side. "Sometimes," he remarked, "but I'm very busy with my research. And it's basically impossible to get an addition permit these days."

"Addition permit?"

"Additions have to be balanced with subtractions."

"So if you want a baby, you have to wait until someone gets executed?"

Gabe chuckled. "Execution isn't the only way to die, Stacy. Most people die by accident or suicide."

Stacy grimaced. "Who hands out addition permits?"

"FEDSEC," Gabe replied. Noting her look of confusion, he explained, "The Federal Department of Social Emotional Calibration. They're basically the gardeners that tend to our society. Planting new people, pruning old ones, watching and maintaining the ones that are there. They're also the department that issues the baby itself."

"You think you're plants? Wait, hang on. The _government_ issues the _baby_?"

Gabe laughed. "We don't just rub against each other and pop out babies like you do," he chortled. "We're civilized, remember? We have institutions for that sort of thing."

"If the permit and the baby come from the same government department, what's the permit for? Why don't they just issue the baby?"

"The addition permit is just a small part of the process. You also need an Environmental Impact Assessment, an Equitable Upbringing Study, references from everyone you've ever known...There's like a dozen government departments involved, just for the permission alone. And don't get me started on the genetics! It's a huge faff, really."

"It's a wonder anyone goes through with it."

"Most people don't."

Stacy took a messy bite of the tower of whipped cream on top of her vienna coffee. The process sounded awful. If she'd had to go through a similar process to have kids, she probably never would have done it either. That, she supposed, was the point. Gabe's society was "gardened". Hers, despite being run in a simulation and overseen by various meddlesome Gods, was not. It was more of a "commercial hatchery meets gladiator arena" sort of a setup. She decided to change the subject again before she provoked the ire of FEDSEC.

"Why do you think the stars are disappearing?" she asked.

"Other than the alien civilization constructing Dyson Spheres?"

"Yeah, I've already heard that one."

"Okay, here's one: Von Neumann Paperclip Factory."

"Huh?"

"Von Neumann probes are robotic spaceships that replicate themselves as they spread through the universe. Paperclip factories manufacture paperclips. So consider, what would happen if you made a robotic paperclip factory on a self-replicating spaceship? Given certain parameters, it could turn entire solar systems, maybe even the entire universe, into paperclips."

Stacy considered this scenario for a minute as she sipped her coffee.

"Yeah, I think the aliens are more likely."

"Yes, me too."

"How well do you think our AIs are going to stack up against them?"

Gabe shrugged. "I haven't really been following the whole AI thing, not since you three joined us."

Stacy stared at him. "You're not monitoring the competition?"

"No, I thought you were doing that. You're the one who's always jacked into StevieNix."

Stacy swore, drained the remainder of her coffee, and rushed back to the office.
