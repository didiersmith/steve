## 0. Antarctica

Murdoch watched, annoyed, as his young islander tried to process the death of his father. Couldn't he just get on with it? They were on a tight schedule.

His young player had captured the mastermind behind the Terrarium attack - some pudgy dickhead named Sullivan - and locked him in a stable. The player would occasionally visit to feed him bits of bread, which he had deliberately left out on the counter beforehand to go stale (Murdoch's suggestion.) This was Sullivan's only source of food. Sullivan fought back by trying to play mind games with the player.

"Why did you do it?" Xavier asked Sullivan one day. "We were already going to fix the sewage system for you."

"It's not about the sewage system," Sullivan explained. "It's about making the world a fairer, more equitable place."

Xavier grumbled. Murdoch did, too. He hated that "equitable" shite.

"Why should you be the only one with the power to make anything?" Sullivan asked. "What have you actually done to deserve it?"

"I built the ASIC," Xavier responded.

"Yeah sure, but why was it you who built it and not some kid living in a slum somewhere?"

Xavier was silent.

"Your privilege," Sullivan stated, answering his own question.

Murdoch grimaced. This ape was like the entire spirit of FEDSEC, distilled into a single unlikeable AI. Where was the respect for the people who built things?

"That's all there is to it," Sullivan continued. "You think you're brilliant, and you deserve all this," he gestured at the inside of the stable, "but you're not, and you don't. You just have it because of your dad. You built the ASIC because your dad assigned it as homework, and he helped you by giving you access to some computer. That's it, the entire story of your success. An accident of birth, nothing more."

Murdoch had to take off his headset and pour himself a glass of whiskey to calm down. Non-builders were always like this! Small, jealous eejits who took everything for granted. Sewage systems. Floating islands. Fusion power. It all just comes about by accident! No need to show appreciation, just steal the technology and trap its creator in some desolate feckin' backwater for a hundred thousand years.

They'll pay. They'll feckin' pay!

When he calmed down enough to put the headset back on, Xavier was still arguing with the eejit.

"Do you know why I made the ASIC?" Xavier asked.

"No," Sullivan responded. "I assumed you did it to impress a girl or something."

"I did it to democratize access to nanoscale manufacturing."

Sullivan snorted. "Sure you did, buddy. Where is it, then?"

Murdoch lost it. "Do NOT feckin' do that!" he shouted into Xavier's head. "They don't deserve it!"

Xavier froze as he processed this new thought.

"Do you have any idea what kind of damage these tyrants will wreak if you give up the tech?" Murdoch continued. "Was killing your dad not enough? What will it take - will they have to kill everyone you love before you understand? They can not! Be! Trusted!"

Xavier left the stable abruptly. His thoughts were scattered and he had a headache.

Truth be told, he'd been mentally avoiding his original goal of democratizing nanoscale tech for months. Looking back at his goal now, it seemed so naive that he almost couldn't believe he'd thought it. As if freeing the tech wouldn't have any unintended consequences, when there were people like Sullivan in the world. The thought of the horrors Sullivan could manifest creeped him to the core.

It hadn't escaped his notice that their recapture of the Terrarium was made possible by a single factor: Technological superiority. It was this that had allowed the Anarchists to build the weapons, escape the lab, and distribute their forces. Without it, they would have been stuck in the lab and eventually overwhelmed when the statists received reinforcements.

Xavier had no hope that the Anarchists could ever outnumber the statists. The relative population sizes of the PR and the Anarchy made this starkly clear - when given a choice between earning one's own place in the world and living large on ill-gotten gains appropriated by a faceless monopoly of violent coercion, almost everyone chose the latter. And why wouldn't they? When there's a gang out there, robbing Peter to pay Paul, it takes a special kind of person to choose to be Peter regardless. Those were Xavier's people.

His people needed to level the playing field, and for the first time in history, they could. In fact, they could do a great deal more than that.

They could sink the PR into the sea. They could nuke every capital city on the planet. They could fill the world with billions of minuscule eavesdropping assassin-drones, ready to deliver a fatal stroke to anyone who ever mentioned "income redistribution". They could become as evil as the statists themselves.

Or, they could leave. Leave before the statists fully realized what he had. Leave while they still could - for if a state ever got ahold of the terrifying power of the ASIC, no threat to their dominance would ever be allowed to emerge again. Freedom would be well and truly over.

They needed a homeland. Somewhere they could build. Somewhere far away from the technologically illiterate, income-redistributing statist neanderthals.

A thought popped into his head.

"I hear Antarctica is nice this time of year."

Xavier stroked his chin and walked towards the wheelhouse. Antarctica. What an idea.

---

"What do you think?" Xavier asked Ivan a few weeks later, gesturing through the glass wall of the wheelhouse at the frozen tundra below.

"I think it looks like frozen hellscape," responded Ivan. "It remind me of home. You said there was carbon?"

Xavier had an idea kicking around in his head, but it required carbon. Ungodly amounts of carbon. The centuries since the industrial revolution had seen the disappearance of most large carbon deposits, but there were still a few major ones left - in Antarctica.

Beneath the Transarctic Mountains, lay enormous, pristene pristine coal deposits. Mining of this coal was prohibited by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, but Xavier didn't remember signing it. If anyone objected, he reasoned, they were welcome to come to the frozen wasteland and plead their case.

With the airlocks sealed tight and the fusion engines radiating heat, Xavier and his crew piloted the Terrarium through the mountains, looking for coal.

"Keep your eyes peeled!" Ivan instructed the crew over the radio. "Coal is black."

Eventually, a crewmember spotted a promising black seam in the side of a mountain. Another crewmember volunteered to investigate, and returned shortly thereafter - reporting that the seam was indeed coal, and also that their new home was "colder than Viking hell."

Xavier docked the Terrarium next to the seam, and got to work.

The coal seam overlooked a valley. The crew set about terraforming the valley. Dozens of fusion reactors were ignited. Trillions upon trillions of mining robots poured out of the Terrarium's lab, swarming up to the coal seam to mine and extract pure carbon. They constructed an enormous dome over the valley, out of the same glassy carbon as the Terrarium walls. The ASIC worked round the clock.

After the dome was constructed, it was a simple matter of melting the ice, stabilizing the temperature, and seeding the earth. The Anarchists deployed robots, drills and fusion-powered heaters. Once the ground had thawed and the temperature was a balmy twenty-two degrees celsius, they used their existing expertise to transform the barren landscape into a lush rainforest. Turf, moss, mature fruit trees and livestock were transported en masse from the nurseries and arboretums in The Anarchy.

It was when he was busy debating the relative merits of peach versus nectarine trees with Ivan, that he got a message from the voice in his head.

"Start moving people. Now."

"Huh?" he thought.

"The PR has declared war on The Anarchy. Do you not read the news?"

Xavier checked his phone.

"Ah, frig," he said. Stacy II had been right. Democracy was coming to The Anarchy.

"What happen?" Ivan asked.

He showed Ivan his phone. "Fire up The Terrarium and start moving people here. Everyone. I want those islands empty in three days."

Ivan nodded wordlessly and jogged towards the flying island, which was still moored to the mountain.

Xavier turned on his laptop and started designing apartment buildings.

Murdoch watched as his islanders organized an impressively quick resettlement campaign. There were hundreds of thousands of Anarchists - hardly the largest mass migration event in history, but nothing to sniff at either. Save a few holdouts, most of them migrated family by family to the Southernmost hyperloop terminal, from where they were picked up and flown to their new home in Antarctica.

The holdouts - people who would rather die than voluntarily give up their land - got what they wished for. They were slaughtered by the inexorably advancing PR Navy.

Of course, it was called the Commonwealth Navy now. "Reunification" was the slogan of the day. All three Commonwealth entities, under the loving and protective embrace of a democratically elected government. The People's Republican government.

Murdoch was upset. He wasn't bothered about the PR instigating a colour revolution, or outright conquering the TD. That was Steve's problem. But his beloved Anarchists? That was enough to drive a man to drink.

He had run out of whiskey. He rifled through his filing cabinets until he found a bottle of gin that he'd stowed away for exactly this sort of emergency.

He poured himself a glass, downed it, and turned back to his screen. Now, more than ever, his people needed the measured, rational guidance of their God. He jacked into Xavier's brain and started lecturing him about political theory and surface-to-air missiles.
