## 0. The Calling

Steve beamed with pride at his three disciples.

"We don't believe in God," said Russell.

His two disciples.

"I do," objected Stacy. "You're not exactly what I pictured though."

At this rate, it would soon be zero disciples. Steve clicked around in the VR menu and switched his avatar to an old man with a long white beard, who looked as if he'd been copied directly off the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. "How's that?"

Russell, Vincent and Stacy all jumped and recoiled as much as the diner booth allowed.

"Yes, that's more what I had in mind," said Stacy.

"It's just an avatar," Steve explained. "I have loads. Check it out!"

He transformed into a tall, handsome young man with long flowing hair. The three jumped again.

"Too real. Go back to the last one," suggested Vincent.

Steve transformed back into the old man. "Believe me yet?"

"I suspect I'm heavily intoxicated" responded Vincent. Russell agreed. Steve sighed.

Stacy was coping with the situation quite well. "I believe you. It's nice to finally meet you, Steve. Why did you bring us here?" she asked.

Steve took a drink from his coffee mug and sighed. Then, noting the confused looks on the other occupants' faces, he tried to explain himself. "I actually have a real cup of coffee in front of me. The sim tracks it. This entire diner," he gestured around, "is modelled around my office. That way, I can sit at my desk and drink my coffee while talking to you guys. Pretty cool, eh?"

The explanation didn't seem to help. His audience seemed even more confused than before. Steve thought for a bit and remembered the actual question.

"Ah yes. Why I brought you here! Okay, allow me to explain."

Over the next sim hour, Steve spoke and his guests listened. He told them almost the entire backstory - including the creation of StevieNix, the Dysoners, and the meme competition - skipping over his financial arrangement with Allen and the cause of his current strife. His guests nodded along and absorbed the explanation, stopping him only occasionally to ask questions. He was very pleased with how receptive they were to the news that they were simulated lifeforms, bred to be psychotic murderers, and aligned via a meme competition that rendered their minds as toys and souls as trophies for the gods. Even Roommate Russ seemed to follow.

Eventually, Stacy spoke up. "You still haven't answered the question."

"Hmm?" asked Steve.

"Why you brought us here," prompted Vincent.

"Ah, yes. I need your help." Steve continued his exposition, recounting the details of the two thousand year arc of his meme, culminating in the explosion of technology and population, before peaking in recent decades and beginning a decline that appeared to be terminal.

"So, the problem is that no one believes in you any more so you can't harvest any more of us for your interstellar army?" asked Stacy. She seemed almost annoyed at him.

"Well yeah, that's one problem" Steve replied. "The bigger issue is the birth rates. You guys were just on the cusp of being useful. How many sword-wielding true believers do you think we need in a space war? We need AIs - er, people - who can fly spaceships, remotely control weapons systems, repair absurdly complicated machines. You were almost finally at that level of technological aptitude, and now you're going to piss it all away by refusing to breed? You're going to let yourself get overrun by Allen's incestuous goat herders?"

Steve took a deep breath. He was getting ahead of himself. 

"So," paraphrased Russell, "you want us to jumpstart a high-fertility, high technology society."

"Filled with people who love you so much that they'll die for you" continued Vincent.

Not bad, apes. "You got it!" Steve said.

"How are we supposed to do that?" asked Stacy.

"I'm sure you'll figure it out!" he replied. "The three of you have been chosen carefully." Turning to Russell, the one who hadn't been chosen that carefully, he continued. "It starts with you. When you wake up, ssh into this IP address and start playing around."

He handed Russell a card, upon which was printed a long string of random-looking letters and numbers. Russell looked at it and closed his eyes, hopefully committing the IPv6 address to memory.

"Good luck! Call me if you need anything" Steve said. He then reached into his VR menu, clicked "exit", and left the diner.
