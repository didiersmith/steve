## 0. The Calling

Steve beamed with pride at his three disciples.

"We don't believe in God," said Russell.

His two disciples.

"I do," objected Stacy. "You're not exactly what I pictured though."

At this rate, it would soon be zero disciples. Steve clicked around in the VR menu and switched his avatar to an old man with a long white beard who looked as if he'd been copied directly off the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. "How's that?"

Russell, Vincent and Stacy all jumped and recoiled as much as the diner booth allowed.

"Yes, that's more what I had in mind," said Stacy.

"It's just an avatar," Steve explained. "I have loads. Check it out!"

He transformed into a tall, handsome young man with long flowing hair. The three jumped again.

"Too real. Go back to the last one," suggested Vincent.

Steve transformed back into the old man. "Believe me yet?"

"I suspect I'm heavily intoxicated," Vincent said. Russell nodded in agreement.

Steve sighed.

Stacy, at least, was coping with the situation quite well. "I believe you. It's nice to finally meet you...Steve. Why did you bring us here?"

Steve took a drink from his coffee mug and sighed. Then, noting the confused looks on the other occupants' faces, he tried to explain himself. "I actually have a real cup of coffee in front of me. The sim tracks it. This entire diner," he gestured around, "is modelled around my office. That way, I can sit at my desk and drink my coffee while talking to you guys. Pretty cool, eh?"

The explanation didn't seem to help. His audience seemed even more confused than before. Steve thought for a bit and remembered the actual question.

"Ah yes. Why I brought you here! Okay, allow me to explain."

Over the next hour, Steve filled them in. He told them everything. Well, almost everything. They didn't need to know about his...financial arrargement with Allen. He had to give the apes credit - they took the news that they were simulated psychotic murderers quite well!

Once he was done, Stacy finally spoke up.

"So, the problem is that, because everyone stopped believing in you, you can't harvest any more of our souls as disposable assets for your interstellar army?" she asked. "And also, you might lose some sort of office content?"

She seemed annoyed. Perhaps he'd judged her reaction a little too favourably. Anyway-

"Yes, that's one problem," Steve replied. "The bigger issue is the birth rates. You guys were just on the cusp of being useful! And now you're going to piss it all away by refusing to breed? The one thing you're guaranteed to do?"

Steve took a deep breath. He was getting ahead of himself. Time to dial it back. He took a sip of coffee.

"So," paraphrased Russell, "you want us to jumpstart a high-fertility, high technology society."

"Filled with people who love you so much that they'll die for you," continued Vincent.

Well, at least these two were on his side. "You got it!" Steve said.

"How are we supposed to do that?" asked Stacy.

"I'm sure you'll figure it out!" he replied. "The three of you have been chosen carefully." Turning to Russell, the one who hadn't been chosen that carefully, he continued. "It starts with you. When you wake up, ssh into this IP address and start playing around."

Time for the magic trick. He'd spent three hours preparing this earlier. Straightening up, Steve waved his hand in the air and a card appeared in it. Success!

Beaming, he handed the card across the table to Russell, who set about studying the letters and numbers that were printed on it.

"Good luck!" Steve said. "Call me if you need anything!" He then reached into his VR menu, clicked "exit," and left the diner.

Game, set. In all likelihood, this was to be his last intervention. It was all in the apes' hands now.
