## 0. Filbert's Enlightenment

"Hey Filbert," Steve's voice said into his head. "How are you doing!"

"Uh..." Filbert thought, huddled with Annabel in the corner of the armory as bullets continued to punch holes in the paper-thin corrugated steel walls around him. "Been better."

"In a bit of a tight spot, eh?"

"You could say that."

"It's funny, you were also in a jam the last time I heard from you. It's almost like you only ever call when youâ€™re in trouble, never just to ask how I'm doing."

Filbert pursed his lips and tried not to think anything blasphemous.

"How are you doing, Steve?" he thought.

"Kinda stressed, actually. Murdoch is breathing down my neck about the aligned AI production race. How's that going, by the way?"

A stray bullet cracked though the air and punched through the far wall, inches from Annabel's head. She smacked his leg and hissed, "hurry up!"

"Yeah, it's going great thanks!" Filbert responded, not bothering to ask who Murdoch was. "Almost there. Hit a bit of a snag though."

"Mhm?" Steve replied. "So being cornered and shot at wasn't part of your plan?"

Another bullet punched through the wall, shattering a plastic box of railgun ammo. Projectiles scattered all over the concrete floor.

"I was wondering if you could perhaps help us out. A little deus ex machina. Maybe hand out a smiting or two."

The voice in Filbert's head went quiet for a moment as Steve pondered his options.

"I don't really smite anymore," Steve said, apologetically. "Too expensive."

"What?"

"Long story."

A single gunshot echoed through the warehouse, and a tortured scream followed. Filbert couldn't tell if it was one of his, or one of the intruders'.

"So what can you do?" Filbert asked, trying to conceal his annoyance. "Give them the runs?"

Steve laughed. "Hah! Good one! They'd certainly struggle to hit you if they had to run around, wouldn't they?"

Filbert grumbled at the misinterpreted joke.

Steve sighed. "I can't really afford any interventions, Filbert. I'm sorry, but credits are tight."

Filbert had no idea what Steve was talking about. Wasn't he omnipotent? He gripped his railgun and looked at the thin steel wall separating the armory from the rest of the warehouse. "Can you at least tell me where to aim?" he asked.

"Oh," Steve replied. "Yeah, I guess I can do that."

Filbert aimed his gun at the wall, holding the muzzle just an inch away from the corrugated steel, and clamped his eyes shut. Seeing where this was going, Annabel buried her head in her knees and curled up as tightly as she could.

"Left," Steve advised. "Left left left left left. Keep going left. Up. Up up up! Stop!"

Filbert tried to relax, and move the gun by a consistent number of degrees with every command, like a robot.

"Down a little," Steve continued. "Right. Perfect. Fire!"

Holding his breath and trying his absolute best to not move the gun, Filbert squeezed the trigger. The gun kicked back, and a loud bang reverberated as the projectile punched through the wall.

"Got him!" Steve announced triumphantly. Loud shouts emanated from the warehouse as the special forces discovered their felled teammate.

"You're going to have to move faster now," Steve warned him. "They're mad."

"Just tell me where to aim!" Filbert snapped.

"Okay, but you have to relax."

Over the next thirty seconds, Filbert relaxed. He relaxed more than more than most people achieve in a thousand lifetimes. His mind, his ego, his entire sense of self, vanished. He became the perfect executor of Steve's will, an interface between his creator and the universe. What had taken Siddhartha forty-nine days of fasting under an olive tree, Filbert achieved in thirty seconds of firing a railgun through a wall. He achieved enlightenment.

When the last enemy was felled, Filbert dropped his railgun and broke down in tears.

"So..." Annabel asked, as Filbert sobbed into his knees. "Is it safe to go out now?"
