## 0. Remarkable Progress

Ever since Steve's decision to bend the rules, Murdoch had enjoyed hanging out with him a lot more. It was like something inside him had snapped. The stick up his butt, perhaps.

"So you're just going to let him create the dumbest form of government ever, eh?" Murdoch asked.

Steve blushed. "You don't know that," he said. "These apes can surprise you."

"What, you think they can come up with something even dumber?"

"That's not what I meant."

Murdoch laughed and pointed at Stacy's territory. "What's she up to?" he asked.

"She's calling it the 'Theocratic Domininion,'" Steve explained. "TD for short."

"Sounds promising."

"It is. The other apes think she's a prophet. She's parlayed that into a divine right to rule. She acts as judge and legislator."

"Legislator, eh?" Murdoch asked. "What are her rules?" 

"The usual stuff. No robbing, killing, sexual assalt. Strict adherance to the alignment meme. Also, no importing weird chemicals."

"And her punishments?"

"Death or transportation."

Murdoch looked at Steve curiously, inviting him to elaborate.

"On conviction, she flips a coin" Steve explained. "Heads, hanging. Tails, one-way hyperloop trip to New Australia."

"New Australia?"

"She had Vincent build her an island. No guards, just wilderness and criminals."

"A penal colony, eh?" Murdoch mused. "Sounds horrendous."

Steve nodded. "Yeah, I wouldn't want to be sent there myself. But the threat sure helps keep them aligned."

"I bet it does," Murdoch said. "And people actually go for this?"

Steve brought up a stats pane. "A decent chunk of them do," he said, pointing at a column of numbers. "For anyone who wants to be aligned and live in a safe country, it's hard to beat. Most people go to the PR though."

"PR?"

"People's Republic. Russell's place."

Murdoch laughed. "The direct democracy welfare state? Okay, walk me through it."

"Basically, Russell has a huge fleet of mining worms that dig gold out of the sea floor. He hands the gold out to people to reward them for living on his island."

"And the people vote on how their society should be run?"

"That's the idea."

Murdoch shook his head. "Yeah, hard to see how that could go wrong."

Seemingly tired of his apes' societies being mocked, Steve turned the conversation to Murdoch's.

"How's your islander going?"

Murdoch smiled a wicked grin. "Couldn't be better," he said.

Vincent's Anarchy was the least popular of the three territories. Only the bravest chose to emigrate there.

Guided by Murdoch's whispers, Vincent rejected state authority as being morally illegitimate - indistinguishable from rule by mafia or warlord. In his view, states were granted power on the basis of two superstitions: That commands are somehow legitimate when they're labeled as "laws", and that violent thugs somehow become upstanding citizens when dressed in uniforms, given badges, and told to enforce those "laws". The cornerstone of his moral code was the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), which states that it is immoral to initiate the use of force upon another person or their property. As states regularly violated the NAP, they were immoral. QED.

Of course, once aggression had been initiated, violence was on the table. Any means at all could be justified to neutralize an aggressor - up to, and including, vigilante execution. In fact, Vincent considered thoughtful participation in vigilante lynch mobs to be a courageous exercise of civic duty, and worked hard to inspire the population to share his inclination. In practice, lynchings were rare - partially because the brutality of the punishment discouraged antisocial behaviour, and partially because Vincent set immigration policy by controlling the only international hyperloop station.

Vincent was the first to admit that, in most parts of the world, an anarchist paradise would likely descend rapidly into a warlord-dominated hellhole (ie. a conventional state.) But he dared to dream, that by cultivating a virtuous population, true freedom from state predation could be achieved.

Unencumbered by the responsibilities of running a state, Vincent spent his time as he preferred - building islands. He and his crew adopted a policy - if any group of people came to them with a neat-enough sounding idea for an autonomous NAP-compliant canton, they'd build the islands necessary to make it happen. Cantons were constructed as conglomerations of small, mobile, hexagonal islands. This design was to encourage secessionism - if an internal dispute occurred within a canton, opposing divisions could simply float apart rather than resort to violence. This extended all the way down to to the household level, and it was common to see individual homesteads, floating alone, adorned with a single house, a barn, and a small collection of livestock.

Just as leaders naturally emerge in any situation where humans need to coordinate, so too did leaders naturally emerge in the cantons. Elections and power struggles were rare - instead, most villages started as projects by two or three friends, one of whom was already the natural leader. As a leader's reputation for fair dealing and good judgment grew, so too did the village. If a leader ever took a turn towards the despotic, the unimpressed villagers would simply unmoor and float away. A market for leadership thus emerged, the likes of which had never before been seen on land.

Cantons could set their own immigration policy within the Anarchy of New Sealand. Initially, these were mostly set according to hyper-local Old World ethnicities, and cantons such as New Inverness, New Vienna, and New Gangnam became major forces. Over time, as the possibilities began to sink in, more creatively constructed cantons arose.

Due to a combination of natural inclination and Murdoch's words of encouragement, these cantons tended to be technology-focused.

A group of venture capitalists set up the Whale Fund. Modelled after a miniature San Francisco Bay Area, it functioned as a startup accelerator. The fund took a 10% stake in any locally-founded companies, in exchange for capital and an administrative apparatus dedicated to building the world's most desirable location for highly talented individuals. The immigration exam involved an IQ test, and the unofficial motto was "live free; build free; throw junkies into the Pacific."

The Whale Fund was immensely successful. Hungry founders and fed-up tech workers flocked to the arc of islands in the Pacific. The canton's business model was endlessly copied and tweaked by competing VCs, chasing after the masses of skilled workers that were rapidly evaporating out of the failed Golden State.

Their model was endlessly replicated. Other technology cantons popped up. Murdoch's personal favourite was Jurrasic Park, whose inhabitants used gene editing technology to create modern-day domesticated dinosaurs. Not useful for creating interstellar warships, but entertaining nonetheless.

He was watching the apes try to saddle an enormous winged dinosaur one day, when his office door burst open and Allen walked in.

"Steve's cheating," Allen announced.

"What do you mean?" Murdoch asked.

"He's flat broke. Can't afford to do anything. And yet, somehow, his apes have managed to invent several centuries' worth of technology in a couple years?"

"Yes, they've made remarkable progress."

"It reeks of divine intervention!"

"Sounds circumstantial."

Allen glared at Murdoch, who put on his best innocent face.

"Why do you care anyway?" Murdoch asked. "You get all his aligned souls. Don't you want him to succeed?"

"I only want him to succeed a little - not so much that he climbs out of default!" Allen replied. "The status quo suited me just fine."

Murdoch sighed. "It's just a stupid competition, Maurice. You have to remember the big picture."

"It's the principle of it!"

"Goddamn it, Maurice, will you drop it?" Murdoch snapped. "Forget the competition! These monkeys are our ticket out of here. Can't you see that?"

Allen's eyes narrowed and he examined Murdoch's face. "You know!" he said. "Steve's cheating and you know about it!"

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

Allen scowled and stomped to the door.

"Mark my words," he said. "I will destroy Steve's stupid meme and his ridiculous islands. New Sealand is done." He walked out and slammed the door.

Murdoch made a mental note to get Steve to speed up time in StevieNix. They had to get cracking.
