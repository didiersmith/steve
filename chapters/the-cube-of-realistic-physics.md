## 0. The Cube of Realistic Physics

Xavier didn't live in his house anymore. Xavier lived in space. The Gods demanded it.

He had scarcely touched down before he was launching again, this time with a new ship design. It was a research lab, designed for space travel. They called it The Building.

The Building was a huge, cylindrical twelve-storey building with a fusion engine on the tail, capable of housing a small population for long periods of time. Each floor was manufactured separately on Earth and flung into space, where Xavier and his crew caught them with nets and space-planes, and assembled them into the final ship.

Once The Building was fully assembled, they flung up the ASIC, filled the building with air, and moved in.

Unlike the Terrarium, The Building wasn't designed to be a self-sufficient colony. Food wasn't grown on board, but was dehydrated and stocked in enormous store-rooms. The air was scrubbed not by plants, but by HEPA filters and an air-recycling plasma reactor. Artificial gravity was achieved not by spinning, but by _going places_ - ie. by running the fusion engine 24/7 and undergoing constant 1g acceleration or deceleration.

It was, on balance, a far less pleasant environment than the floating islands of New Sealand, the Terrarium, or the Antarctic Dome. On the other hand, it was in space. Xavier had no shortage of volunteers. Ivan joined him as first mate, and many of his best scientists and engineers followed.

The top floor was dedicated as the bridge, the bottom floor the engine room, and a few other floors the living quarters. The remaining floors were filled with computers, manufacturing equipment, the ASIC, and lab animals.

"Don't run your fusion engine in there," cautioned his dad. "Subatomic physics is totally different. Your engine will probably explode and kill everyone. You're just going to have to coast through on momentum."

"Is momentum the same as here?" Xavier asked the voice in his head. He was clipped into his chair in the top floor of The Building, facing an enormous cube that was outlined with a glowing red grid. Inside the cube, he was told, was empty space and a completely different physics engine. His dad called it "the Cube of Realistic Physics", or "CORP" for short.

"Yes, good old p = mv," replied his dad. "Think of it as if Newton designed the universe, and he got some help from the guy who came up with the subatomic...particle...orbity model. Who was that again? Bohr?"

"Rutherford."

"Right. Just testing you. In any case, do NOT run your fusion engine in there. I'm serious. You will die."

"Sure, okay, no fusion engine. What about my brain?" Xavier asked. "Does it rely on our subatomic physics?"

"It's been hard to get a straight answer out of Steve on that front," his dad replied. "Hang on, I'll put him on."

A few moments later, Steve's voice appeared. "How are you doing, Xavier?"

"Great, thanks. Admiring this beautiful red cube you've made me."

"Do you like it? It glows green on the inside!"

"Very nice. If I go inside, will I die?"

Steve was silent for a moment, before replying, "I don't think so."

"You don't think so?"

"You're worried about your brain, right?"

"Right."

"Don't! There's no need to worry about your brain. Your brain is just an interface between your mind and your body."

"What?"

"Your mind doesn't run on your brain. It runs on an MHI-10 in a datacenter, along with a hundred million other minds. If your mind ran on your squishy little monkey brain, how would we ever move it elsewhere?"

"Uh..."

"Maybe we need to give his mind some extra compute cycles so he can keep up," his dad snickered in the background.

"Ignore him," Steve said. "The point is, don't worry about your brain."

"What should I worry about?"

"Your mitochondria. I have no idea how those work."

"Great," thought Xavier. "That's reassuring. So why don't you think I'll die if I go in the cube?"

"How much impact could subatomic effects possibly have on your mitochondria? Can't be that much. I'd put the probability of death at no higher than...thirty percent."

Xavier didn't feel like personally testing those odds. He was going to have to try something else.

Xavier and his team put a canary in a glass ball and threw it into the cube. Then, they flew around to the other side and caught the canary when it came out. The bird was angry and covered in poop, but alive.

They waited two days. The bird was still alive. It was Xavier's turn.

He climbed into his space-plane and steered it towards the cube.

"We're all clear," crackled Ivan's voice through the radio. "Light her up!"

Xavier gripped the wheel of his space-plane tightly and stared nervously at the red Cube of Realistic Physics in front of him. He tried to reassure himself. The canary had survived. How dangerous could it be?

"Launching," he responded with a final glance up at The Building. "See you on the other side."

He ignited his fusion engine and was shoved back into his chair as the plane jolted forwards. After a fraction of a second, he shut the engine off again and coasted towards the cube.

"Good job," his dad said into his head. "Now don't you dare touch that ignition until you come out the other side."

"Thanks, Dad," Xavier responded. "Why don't you worry less about me being an idiot and more about my mitochondria?"

"Your mitochondria will be fine. The bird was okay, right? I'm more worried about the plane's chemical bonds disintegrating and you being sucked out into the vacuum."

The red grid surrounding the CORP filled Xavier's field of view as he rapidly coasted towards it.

"You're worried about _what_?" he asked.

"Never mind!" his dad responded. "Too late!"

The plane reached the grid and Xavier blacked out.

When he came to, his hands were still on the wheel. It couldn't have been more than a couple seconds, he reasoned, but the scene was completely different. Everything outside the spacecraft was gone. The Sun, the Earth, the entire universe as he knew it - were all replaced with an enormous glowing green grid in a cube surrounding him. The grid provided his only light source - all of the lights in the plane were off, and everything he could see was illuminated in an eerie green.

"Xavier?" came his dad's panicked voice in his head. "Come in, Xavier!"

"Am I alive?" Xavier asked. He removed his hands from the wheel and opened and closed them in front of his face. They still worked.

His dad exhaled loudly into the microphone. "Looks like it. You had me scared."

"What happened?"

"We had to pause your mind for a sec as your brain crossed the barrier."

Xavier nodded. That made sense, sort of. "Why are all my lights dead?" he asked.

"LEDs rely on subatomic effects. They don't work here."

"Why not?"

"Light is totally different in Realistic Physics. It's never a wave - it's all particles, all the time. Like billiards balls."

Xavier looked around the dimly illuminated cabin. "Is that why everything's green? There are only green billiards balls?"

His dad laughed. "You don't like the green? Steve thought it would be 'soothing.'"

"Do you have any other colours?"

"This is meant to resemble a forest."

Xavier looked out the windshield at the glowing grid around him. It looked absolutely nothing like a forest.

"I'll see what Steve can do," his dad said.

Xavier sat silently in his thoughts and watched the green grid slowly fly past. Boredom began creeping in. He hadn't packed any experiments to perform in the Realistic Physics engine - the only mission objectives were to survive, and maintain his sanity. With his dad babbling into his head, the success of the latter was far from guaranteed. Fortunately, the subject of conversation was at least somewhat interesting.

"But seriously," Xavier asked, "how do colours work? If light isn't a wave, you can't vary its wavelength."

"Colour is determined by how fast the photons spin."

"Oh."

"They also have mass," Vincent continued enthusiastically, "and no hardcoded speed!"

Xavier blinked, confused. "Then how fast is light speed?"

"As fast as you throw it. With enough energy, we could have real-time conversations across the galaxy. I told you, this universe is basically Newtonian."

Xavier pondered this newfound information as he drifted towards the far wall of the CORP. So, his skin was being bombarded with particles. Great. Back on Earth, bombarding people with particles was called "proton radiation therapy" and was used in a sparing, targeted fashion to irradiate cancerous cells to death. He wished he'd observed the bird for longer than two days before entering the cube. Perhaps they should have used an animal that wasn't covered in feathery radiation shielding. A naked mole rat, for instance.

"Photons, not protons," his dad corrected his thoughts. "They're different."

"Thanks, dad," Xavier responded. "How do I know these _photons_ aren't going to give me radiation sickness or melt off my skin?"

"Beats me," his dad responded. "Guess we'll find out."

Xavier forced a laugh, and fidgeted as he drifted through the cube, mind ablaze with questions. How did the rods and cones in his eyes detect these weird photons? How did electricity work? How were the space-plane's chemical bonds doing? His dad politely remained silent, although Xavier was sure that he and the rest of the office were still listening to his thoughts.

Eventually, the plane approached the far wall. Xavier shook his head, breathed deeply, and put his hands back on the wheel. He hated the cube, and couldn't wait to get out.

"Are you going to pause me for the transition again?" he asked.

"Yup," his dad responded. "In three, two..."

The world went black and Xavier woke up on the other side. The cabin lights were on, and his headset roared with the sounds of Ivan and his crew cheering.
