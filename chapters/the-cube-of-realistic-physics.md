## 0. The Cube of Realistic Physics

"We're all clear," crackled Ivan's voice through the radio. "Light her up!"

Xavier gripped the wheel of his space-plane tightly and stared nervously at the red Cube of Realistic Physics (CORP) in front of him. He hadn't been in the plane since his maiden voyage, when he'd spun out of control and had to be rescued by his dad's disembodied voice. Now, with the flashbacks of that flight triggering mild nausea, he was about to perform another first: The first human mission into the CORP.

The canary they'd sent through two days ago had survived. How dangerous could it be?

"Launching," he responded with a final glance up at the receding Building. "See you on the other side."

He ignited his fusion engine and was shoved back into his chair as the plane jolted forwards. After a fraction of a second, he shut the engine off again and coasted towards the cube.

"Good job," Vincent said into his head. "Now don't you dare touch that ignition until you come out the other side."

"Thanks, Dad," Xavier responded. "Why don't you worry less about me being an idiot and more about my mitochondria?"

"Your mitochondria will be fine. The bird was okay, right? I'm more worried about the plane's chemical bonds disintegrating and you being sucked out into the vacuum."

The red grid surrounding the CORP filled Xavier's field of view as he rapidly coasted towards it.

"You're worried about _what_?" he asked.

"Never mind!" his dad responded. "Too late!"

The plane reached the grid and Xavier blacked out.

When he came to, his hands were still on the wheel. It couldn't have been more than a couple seconds, he reasoned, but the scene was completely different. Everything outside the spacecraft was gone. The Sun, the Earth, the entire universe as he knew it - were all replaced with an enormous glowing green grid in a cube surrounding him. The grid provided his only light source - all of the lights in the plane were off, and everything he could see was illuminated in an eerie green.

"Xavier?" came his dad's panicked voice in his head. "Come in, Xavier!"

"Am I alive?" Xavier asked. He removed his hands from the wheel and opened and closed them in front of his face. They still worked.

His dad exhaled loudly into the microphone. "Looks like it. You had me scared."

"What happened?"

"We had to pause your mind for a sec as your brain crossed the barrier."

Xavier nodded. That made sense, sort of. "Why are all my lights dead?" he asked.

"LEDs rely on subatomic effects. Those effects don't work here."

"Why not?"

"Light is totally different in Realistic Physics. It's never a wave - it's all particles, all the time. Like billiards balls, remember?"

Xavier looked around the dimly illuminated cabin. "Is that why everything's green? There are only green billiards balls?"

His dad laughed. "You don't like the green? Steve thought it would be 'soothing.'"

"Do you have any other colours?"

"This is meant to resemble a forest."

Xavier looked out the windshield at the glowing grid around him. It looked absolutely nothing like a forest.

"I'll see what Steve can do," his dad said.

Xavier sat silently in his thoughts and watched the green grid slowly fly past. Boredom began creeping in. He hadn't packed any experiments to perform in the Realistic Physics engine - the only mission objectives were to survive, and maintain his sanity. With his dad babbling into his head, the success of the latter was far from guaranteed. Fortunately, the subject of conversation was at least somewhat interesting.

"But seriously," Xavier asked, "how do colours work? If light isn't a wave, you can't vary its wavelength."

"Colour is determined by how fast the photons spin."

"Oh."

"They also have mass," Vincent continued enthusiastically, "and no hardcoded speed!"

Xavier blinked, confused. "Then how fast is light speed?"

"As fast as you throw it. With enough energy, we could have real-time conversations across the galaxy. I told you, this universe is basically Newtonian."

Xavier pondered this newfound information as he drifted towards the far wall of the CORP. So, his skin was being bombarded with particles. Great. Back on Earth, bombarding people with particles was called "proton radiation therapy" and was used in a sparing, targeted fashion to irradiate cancerous cells to death. He wished he'd observed the bird for longer than two days before entering the cube. Perhaps they should have used an animal that wasn't covered in feathery radiation shielding. A naked mole rat, for instance.

"Photons, not protons," his dad corrected his thoughts. "They're different."

"Thanks, Dad," Xavier responded sarcastically. "How do I know these _photons_ aren't going to give me radiation sickness or melt off my skin?"

"Beats me," his dad responded. "Guess we'll find out."

Xavier forced a laugh, and fidgeted as he drifted through the cube, mind ablaze with questions. How did the rods and cones in his eyes detect these weird photons? How did electricity work? How were the space-plane's chemical bonds doing? His dad politely remained silent, although Xavier was sure that he and the rest of the office were still listening to his thoughts.

Eventually, the plane approached the far wall. Xavier shook his head, breathed deeply, and put his hands back on the wheel. He hated the cube, and couldn't wait to get out.

"Are you going to pause me for the transition again?" he asked.

"Yup," his dad responded. "In three, two..."

The world went black and Xavier woke up on the other side. The cabin lights were on, and his headset roared with the sounds of Ivan and his crew cheering.

The crew spent the next week monitoring Xavier for strange health conditions, and manufacturing otherworldly industrial equipment from Steve-provided CAD designs. Some of the equipment had obvious functions - a lathe looks like a lathe, no matter what universe you're in - and others were entirely foreign.

"What's this?" asked Ivan, tapping on a large, black cylinder covered in brass protrusions.

"I think it's some kind of photolithography machine," Xavier responded.

Ivan raised an eyebrow at him.

"For making chips," Xavier explained. "Don't turn it on. Even Steve doesn't know what this stuff will do in StevieNix Physics."

"What if I'm hungry?" Ivan asked, coyly reaching for the power switch. "I love chips!"

Xavier glared at him.

"Ha ha!" Ivan laughed, retracting his hand. "Is joke! I think perhaps radiation may have affected your sense of humour. Let's get you to medic."

"My sense of humour is fine," Xavier grumbled.

In truth, his sense of humour was subdued. The crew had unanimously voted that morning that the entire Building would perform the next mission into the CORP. As it had been several days since Xavier's mission and he hadn't vomited blood or developed visible tumours, the general consensus was that Realistic Physics was "probably safe enough". Xavier felt a weight of responsibility he hadn't borne since the invasion of the Terrarium. If the consensus was wrong, he'd be responsible for not just scores of deaths, but the deaths of the smartest, bravest people he knew.

"Well then, funny man, let's go to the bridge! Everyone's waiting," Ivan said cheerily, striding towards the elevator.

Xavier followed him to the bridge where most of the crew were indeed excitedly waiting. They ceased their chattering and looked towards him as the doors slid open and he entered with Ivan.

"Remember everyone," he announced, "we won't be able to accelerate while we're in there. You know what that means, right?"

"No gravity!" several crewmembers shouted in unison.

"That's right. So make sure everything is strapped down. We'll be in the CORP for twelve hours, which should be enough time to test all the equipment. We'll be hitting our approach velocity in a few minutes, so jump to it!"

The crew scattered to the various levels to prepare for microgravity, and Xavier sat down in his chair. He sighed, leaned his head back, and closed his eyes.

Ivan sat next to him. "You are scared, boss?" he asked.

Xavier looked over at him. "You know what else not being able to accelerate means?"

Ivan nodded. "Once we're in, we cannot abort mission. Everybody knows this."

"And you're not scared?"

Ivan shook his head. "Is only twelve hours. Easy peasy."

"Yeah," Xavier replied. "Easy peasy."

His heart thudded in his chest, and he felt the familiar nausea rising in his stomach. He wasn't scared. He was terrified.
