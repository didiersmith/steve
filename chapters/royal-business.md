## 0. Royal Business

Stacy II held back her tears as she stepped out of the hyperloop shuttle onto Vincent and Xavier's homestead. Crying over one's dead mother was simply not _regal_.

Now, more than ever, she had to act her role. Her new role. Barring divine intervention - and given her brief interaction with Steve, that didn't seem to be in the cards - she'd just been promoted from heir apparent. Her new position was the one for which she'd been bred and raised: Queen Stacy II, ruler of the Theocratic Dominion.

Queen in exile, that was.

"They're dead, aren't they?" asked Filbert. "My dad's dead."

Vincent hugged Filbert in consolation. He looked at her as if to offer a hug too, but she shook her head.

Requiring hugs was not _regal_.

"Do you have a boat?" she asked Vincent.

"We can make you one," he replied. "Where are you going?"

"I'm going to take back the Dominion."

"No you're not."

"Yes I am! And you" - she pointed at Filbert - "are coming with me."

Filbert looked at her in surprise.

"The two of us are going to quash a rebellion?" he asked. "With what army?"

"Don't worry," Stacy II said. "We'll raise an army."

Vincent and Xavier looked at her skeptically.

"A proper seafaring vessell, please" she said. "With two independent cabins" she added, with a sideways look at Filbert.

"Do you want us to come with you?" Xavier asked.

"No. You two need to prepare the Anarchy for war. Now that the PR's gotten an appetite for spreading democracy, it's only a matter of time."

The two Anarchists nodded and departed to Vincent's nanoscale factory.

Her boat was ready a short time later. She packed some basic provisions, slung her railgun over her back, and dragged Filbert on board.

"Where are we going?" he asked as they pulled out of the harbour.

"To the one part of the TD that's still technically under my command," she replied. "New Australia."

Filbert swallowed wordlessly.

"Now. If you'll excuse me," she said, "I have some royal business to attend to."

She nodded her head at Filbert and retired into her cabin. Upon shutting the door, she collapsed onto her bed and filled her pillow with tears.
