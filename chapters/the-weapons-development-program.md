# 46. The Weapons Development Program

"Get rid of them," Vincent advised. "Statists are bad news."

"I can't!" Xavier objected. "Firstly, their boat's drifted off. But more importantly, that's no way to treat anyone! They're just normal people like us, dad!"

"They are absolutely not!" Vincent responded. "They're adherents to a violent barbarian ideology. Statists are incompatible with free society. They'll destroy everything you've ever built. Find their boat, drop them on it, and fly away, I'm serious."

"You're just talking about extremists, dad! There's no way all statists are that bad."

"Look," Vincent replied, exasperated. "Fine. I'll admit, individually, most statists are not that bad. Some of my best friends are statists. But once they reach a critical mass, they'll subjugate the rest of your society and raise your children to believe that being able to choose your slave-master is the same as being free! Your people will never know liberty again. And the worst part is, the statists will expect to be thanked for it! The absolute bastards."

Xavier seemed unconvinced.

"Don't forget what they did to Stacy," cautioned Vincent.

"But Stacy was a statist!" Xavier argued.

"And even that didn't save her, did it?" Vincent pointed out. "They'll eat their own. As I said, bad news."

Xavier ignored his dad and invited the refugees to dinner. They told him about the sewage crisis in the People's Republic. He'd read that there were some issues in that domain, but hadn't heard a first-hand account.

"So why can't you just rip the lift stations out and replace them with conventional ones?" he asked.

"They're cast into the foundations of the island," responded the pudgy man with the nasal voice. "We don't have anything that can cut the fullerene."

Xavier marveled. Fullerene cutters were as common in the Anarchy as shovels in the Old World. "So you don't have any nanoscale tech at all?"

The man shook his head. "Not since the event."

Xavier nodded. "I'll have to see what I can do to help," he stated. "I bet we can replace the lift stations pretty easily."

With the help of the ASIC, he and his crew assembled a temporary sleeping quarter for their guests. It was a small single-room cottage, with two rows of silk hammocks. Tight, but space came at a premium in the Terrarium. In any case, it was substantially roomier than the boat. He bid his guests good night, strolled to the wheelhouse to set a course for the PR, and went to bed.

He was awoken two hours later by the sounds of screaming and gunfire. He rushed into the hallway, where he ran into his father, clad in his pajamas and gripping his railgun.

"Don't shoot that in here!" Xavier yelled, pointing at the railgun. "If you hit a wall, the whole Terrarium will blow apart!"

"You didn't design the glass to be bulletproof?" Vincent asked, shocked.

"Obviously it's bulletproof," Xavier responded, annoyed, "it's just not one-atom-thick diamond projectile-proof! We'd never be able to take off with that kind of constraint."

Vincent roared and threw his railgun against the wall. "Then build it with small independent panels so the loss of one doesn't compromise the integrity of the entire structure! You're telling me that this entire cabin is one big single point of failure? Have I taught you nothing?"

"It's a proof of concept! I didn't expect you to come in, guns blazing, turning the whole place into the Wild West!"

"I'm not the one who-" Vincent stopped himself. The kid had learned his lesson already. "Come on," he said. Retrieving his railgun, he pushed open the front door and strode out into the dark.

It was bedlam. Unarmed and unable to return fire, Xavier's crew was running around in search of cover, as tracer rounds streaked overhead and ricocheted off the walls of the Terrarium.

"Fall back!" Xavier yelled. "To the lab!"

Most of his crew made it to the laboratory alive. They barricaded the doors and took stock of the situation, while Vincent watched through the windows for stragglers.

"They killed all the ketzels," bemoaned one of the women.

"They killed my son!" wept a disconsolate mother. Her son had been six years old.

A couple of the survivors had been wounded, and various crew members set about tending to them. The rest of them looked to Xavier for guidance.

Xavier's face burned hot with shame. He should never have let the statists on board. His father glared at him with a look, that at once said both "I told you so," and "what are you going to do now?"

Xavier stood up to speak. "I'm sorry I let them on board," he announced. "You all trusted me with your lives, and I let you down."

The mother wailed. Xavier had no idea how to continue his speech.

"We're clearly in a bit of a sticky situation here," he continued, grasping for words, "but I promise you, the deaths of our fallen will be avenged. Now, who here has weapons?"

Save Vincent, no one had weapons. Railguns, while commonly carried in the Anarchy, were banned on board the Terrarium. No suitable replacement had been developed, and no one had thought to import conventional small arms. Guns simply hadn't been immediately necessary, so everyone had forgotten about them.

"Right," Xavier announced, "I guess we all know what we need to do."

The ASIC was spun up, with its trillion-strong army of robots, to manufacture a makeshift shooting range along one side of the laboratory. A thick foamy backstop was produced, and in front of it were erected six individual shooting lanes, terminating in transparent panels of the same glassy material as the Terrarium walls. A ballistic gel extruder was created, and it set about forming block after block of pink, translucent, flesh-mimicking substance. Each gel block was covered in a kevlar case, the thickness of a standard military-issue bulletproof vest. 

Vincent stepped up to a lane with his railgun and fired a single shot towards the panel at the end of the lane. The panel exploded into thousands of tiny shards. Xavier had been correct in his concern. 

All crewmembers who were neither wounded, nor tending to the wounded, were enlisted in history's most rapid weapons development program. The goal was to modify Vincent's railgun and projectile design to find a combination of parameters that didn't harm the glass, while still penetrating the kevlar and dealing maximum damage to the ballistic gel behind it. Laptops, goggles, and ear muffs were handed out. A deadline was set for six hours.

Almost immediately after the nanoscale robots finished manufacturing the first prototype, the ground jerked under everyone's feet. Xavier stumbled and grabbed onto his desk for balance. "They must be in the wheelhouse," he theorized out loud.

"I wonder where they're taking us," Vincent responded.

Xavier pulled out his phone. Although the Terrarium had been designed with only the slightest wink to aerodynamic efficiency, the six fusion engines mounted on the balloons put out enough power to move the island at quite a decent clip. His map indicated their heading hadn't changed, merely their velocity - the engines were running at full throttle, steaming towards the People's Republic.

"Deadline's been moved," he announced to his team. "Battle stations in three hours."

The team split into design and testing sub-teams, the designers all experimenting with different combinations of projectile speed and tip diameter, and the testers blasting the experimental rounds into the panels and gel.

It was relatively easy to tell if a design dealt sufficient damage to the gel - for the most part, only a single round had to be fired. An automatic target carrier would transport the gel back to the testing team, who would assess how far the projectile had penetrated the kevlar, and whether it was able to dump its entire kinetic payload into the simulated flesh behind it.

It was much harder to tell if a design was "panel-safe". It was here that the main compromise in Xavier's glass surfaced - the imperfections in the material caused by the integrated circuit. The embedded wires and transistors were tiny and far between, but they formed weak points that, if struck directly, could compromise the entire panel. It was not uncommon for a panel to take a hundred rounds without showing a single scratch, before being completely destroyed by an unluckily-placed hundred and first round.

The panel-safety criterion was set at ten thousand rounds - ie., for a gun/projectile design to be deemed panel-safe, a panel would have to survive ten thousand rounds from the combination in question.

The testing team built automatic turrets, which would pan the guns across the target panels while shooting continuously. The design team set about modifying their guns to support optional belt feeding, external cooling, and auxiliary power. At 800 rounds per minute, it would take twelve and a half minutes of continuous firing to prove a gun panel-safe. Fortunately, most designs were invalidated much sooner than that. Panel after panel was shattered and replaced.

Eventually, as one design passed the ten minute mark, it became the clear favourite. The tip of its projectile was much thicker than Vincent's - one hundred and fifty nanometers, or roughly a thousand carbon atoms. Instead of diamond, the tip was made from a flexible carbon dome which would deform upon hard impact, thus never focusing too much pressure on any one point. Despite being much larger than the transistors embedded in the glass panels, the tip was still fifty times smaller than a single kevlar filament, which allowed the dart to still easily penetrate the woven para-aramid fabric of a bulletproof vest.

For additional panel-safety, the projectile flew at Mach 2. While it didn't have quite the devastating effect as Vincent's Mach 5 projectile on the ballistic gel, the dart still contained the cocktail-umbrella mechanism, and the result was still almost certainly lethal. An additional benefit of the reduced speed was that the designers could shorten the barrel of the gun. The resulting carbine was substantially lighter and quicker to aim.

One by one, the testers, and then the designers, dropped what they were doing to watch the carbine blast round after round into the panel. Projectile debris piled up on the floor of the lane. No one bothered to replace the competing designs as they shattered their panels, and the air reverberated with the rhythmic clack-clack-clack of 13.3 of the single carbine's projectiles hitting the panel every second.

When it finally reached the ten thousand round mark without damaging the panel, the entire team erupted in cheers and applause. With thirty minutes left on the clock and a new baseline achieved, the team split once more - a small group set about tweaking the carbine for ergonomics, and the rest moved on to designing body armour and grenades.

For the first time in two hours, the range was silent. Xavier took off his ear muffs, and heard his phone ringing. He answered it and beckoned at his dad to listen in.

"Finally," said the nasal voice on the other end of the call. "I've tried calling you six times."

"Sorry," Xavier replied. "It's a bit noisy in here with all the distraught mothers and all, you asshole. How did you get my number?"

"Distraught mothers, eh? Sounds more like automatic gunfire. You're not trying to develop a railgun that causes massive bodily harm without damaging your glass house, are you?"

"No," Xavier lied, unconvincingly.

"Good. Because we have a couple of people here who you might be interested in speaking to. I think they want to discourage you from any rash behaviour."

The voice on the other end of the line changed, to one Xavier and Vincent both recognized. "Hey Xavier, it's me, Theo. They've got Gwyn as well."

Theodore and Gwynyth had spent fifteen years on Vincent's crew. They had retired to a homestead a couple of years ago to spend more time with their grandchildren, before finding themselves yearning for adventure. Gwynyth was responsible for the Mediterranean-inspired flat-roofed architecture of the Terrarium's buildings. Theodore had designed the huge carbon foam blocks making up the walls, which looked and felt exactly like stone but weighed less than a kilogram each.

"They want me to tell you that if you try to attack, they'll kill us both. I say - oof!"

Theo was cut off before he could complete his sentence. The nasal voice returned. "That's enough of that, Theo!" he chuckled. "You heard the man. We're almost at our destination - in a couple of hours, this will all be over. All you have to do is sit tight, relax, and neither Theo, nor Gwyn, nor anyone else will get hurt."

The line went dead.

Xavier looked at his dad, who shook his head. "Don't trust him," he said. "As soon as they get reinforcements, they'll storm the lab and either kill us all, or take us prisoner and force us into nanoscale design slavery. Statists, remember?"

Xavier blinked. He had been so caught up in the weapons development program that he hadn't even considered the motivations of the hijackers. Now that his dad had said it, the motivations were obvious: They wanted the ASIC, and the people who knew how to operate it.

"If we storm them, do you think they'll kill Theo and Gwyn?" he asked.

Vincent nodded. "Probably at least one of them. But that's okay."

"Why on earth would that be okay?"

"Son," Vincent sighed, "Theo and Gwyn are about as aligned as it's possible to be. When they die, there's no question where they're going to go. I hope to meet them there someday. Never forget who all this is for," he said, gesturing around the lab.

Xavier looked at his dad with newfound appreciation. He realized, in that moment, that his dad truly believed the stories he had told him while he was growing up. The MHI-10 wasn't just some computer that he and his friends had happened across, it was a bona fide piece of divine intervention. Indisputable proof of his creator's personal involvement, hard evidence that there was more to existence than the universe itself.

He shook himself out of his revelation and checked the map on his phone. They were almost at the PR.

"Everybody!" he shouted. "R and D is over! Pick a favourite design and move to production. I want to see every man holding a carbine in the next three minutes!"
