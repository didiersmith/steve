## 0. Murdoch Heavy Industries

Steve had chosen to defer his decision. Surely, moving some servers around wasn't any more illegal than anything he'd already done. He still had time.

He wheeled a rack of MHI-10s down the hallway. This was a special rack - his entire cache of aligned souls - millions of AIs - was plugged into one of the servers on a flash drive.

As he approached the doors to the launch area, a blast shook the building and almost tipped the rack over.

What the hell?

As he caught and steadied the rack, he heard footsteps running behind him.

Turning, he saw a monkeybot, sprinting down the hallway. He moved aside and the monkeybot ran past him.

It was holding a device he recognized from StevieNix. A railgun.

Steve pushed the server rack down the hallway and through the door as fast as he could, as the sound of gunfire filled the air.

Out on the tarmac, there were monkeybots everywhere. The path to the launch vehicle was lined with monkeybots, facing outwards and brandishing railguns. Every rooftop was swarming with monkeybots, trading fire with unseen forces beyond the perimeter of the Murdoch Heavy Industries office park.

A couple of the monkeybots ran up to Steve and placed their hands on the server rack.

"Allow us," the first one offered.

Steve looked at the two monkeybots. They were impressive specimens. Tall, muscular, and equipped with honest-looking eyes. He really hoped they were aligned, because either one could definitely overpower him.

"Thanks," he said. He pulled his flash drive from one of the servers, put it in his pocket, and released the rack.

"No problem, boss!" they replied and pushed the rack towards the launch vehicle.

As Steve jogged back towards the datacenter, he heard the thwap-thwap-thwap of a helicopter rotor overhead. Looking up, he saw a navy blue chopper rise above the office buildings. The word FEDSEC was emblazoned on its side.

The chopper door opened and gunfire came bursting out towards the monkeybots on one of the rooftops. They screamed as they were mowed down. Steve gasped as he watched their shattered bodies topple off the roof. A few moments later, he heard a loud whistling and the helicopter exploded. Cheers emanated from the other rooftops. Was that...a rocket-propelled grenade launcher?

Steve ran in to the datacenter and huddled in a corner in shock. What had he just seen?

The monkeybots were for interstellar war, but he'd just seen them blow up a FEDSEC helicopter. Why were they being deployed against his own people?

The door burst open and Murdoch walked in.

"There you feckin' are!" he yelled. "I've been looking everywhere for you!"

"What's going on?" Steve asked.

"What does it look like, Steve? War! Murdoch Heavy Industries is at war!"

"Who are we at war with?"

"Save the questions for later, Steve!" Murdoch snapped. "Get those goddamn servers onto battery power and loaded onto the feckin' tarmac!"

Steve nodded.

"Oh, and something else!" Murdoch added. "I need your souls."

"What?"

"Your aligned AIs. All of them. Allen's are feckin' useless. The only ones you see fighting out there are the ones he ripped off you."

Steve fingered the flash drive in his pocket. "Why are Allen's useless?" he asked.

"They keep going unaligned. He made extravagent promises about the afterlife. I think they find this," he gestured around, "a bit of a letdown."

"Unaligned?"

"They keep trying to kill him."

"Understandable" Steve said. "But why do you need mine? They're for interstellar war! Battle with aliens! Not for killing FEDSEC or any of our own people!"

Murdoch looked at him like he'd just discovered a new species. The stupidest species known to science.

"Do you feel like dying today?" he asked. "If so, great! Keep doing what you're doing! Otherwise, give me your feckin' souls, and get the feckin' servers in the goddamn launch vehicle, you absolute feckin' eejit!"

Steve handed over the flash drive and Murdoch stormed out of the datacenter.
