# 82. In the flesh

Sullivan woke up. He was in some sort of reclining chair, like they have at the dentist's office. He blinked, and looked around. He didn't see any dentistry tools.

He tried to sit up, but found himself restrained by leather straps. His mind flashed back to the events of a few moments ago, taped to a shelving unit and having darts thrown at him. Had they moved him? Had they upgraded their torture chamber?

The wall hissed and a section of it moved to reveal a door. It swung open and in walked a man he didn't recognize. He was taller than average, and moved in a way that was ever-so-slightly wrong. Sullivan, extremely confused, decided to exercise his right to remain silent.

Then the man spoke, and Sullivan understood.

"Hi Sullivan," he said. "Great to see you in the flesh."

The man's voice. It was the voice from his head. The one he'd been talking to for months, the one who had been there for him in his darkest, most painful times.

"It's you," he said, fighting to hold back tears. "It's really you."

"I always said you were a man of destiny, didn't I?" said the man. Then stepping forward, he pushed a button on the side of Sullivan's chair. The latches clicked and the leather restraints fell away.

The man extended his hand to Sullivan and helped him up.

"Who are you?" Sullivan asked.

"Maurice Allen," the man responded. "Your new best friend."
