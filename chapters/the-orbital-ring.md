## 0. The Orbital Ring

The funeral was well-attended. While Vincent had never attempted to gain or exercise any sort of authority, he had still managed to achieve an almost religious status among residents of the Anarchy. Their family homestead was overwhelmed for weeks, by well-wishers who commuted thousands of kilometers to pay their respects to the man who'd started it all.

Xavier was relieved that no one seemed to blame him for his father's death, even though it happened on his ship, under his command.

"Your dad didn't take commands," one guest said simply.

"It's how he would have wanted to go - fighting the damned statists," said another.

"Don't worry; he's with Steve now," was the most common consolation.

Xavier kept the pudgy statist with the nasal voice as a prisoner of war in one of the Terrarium's stables. His name was Sullivan. Xavier hated him.

"Why did you do it?" he asked Sullivan one day. "We were already going to fix the sewage system for you."

Sullivan sighed, as if to say "here we go again."

"It's not about the sewage system," he explained condescendingly. "It's about making the world a fairer, more equitable place."

Xavier grumbled. He'd heard this part before.

"Why should you be the only one with the power to make anything?" Sullivan asked. "What have you actually done to deserve it?"

"I built the ASIC," Xavier responded.

"Yeah sure, but why was it you who built it and not some kid living in a slum somewhere?"

Xavier was silent.

"Your privilege," Sullivan stated, answering his own question.

Xavier grimaced. He hated that word.

"That's all there is to it," Sullivan continued. "You think you're brilliant, and you deserve all this," he gestured at the inside of the stable, "but you're not, and you don't. You just have it because of your dad. You built the ASIC because your dad assigned it as homework, and he helped you by giving you access to some computer. That's it, the entire story of your success. An accident of birth, nothing more."

Xavier fumed. He thought of counter-examples - Filbert had been born in a similar position and had accomplished nothing - but Filbert was dumber than him, less driven, and more conventional in his thought. Were Xavier's intelligence, motivation and creativity also mere "accidents of birth"? What about him was not?

"Do you know why I made the ASIC?" he asked.

"No," Sullivan responded. "I assumed you did it to impress a girl or something."

"I did it to democratize access to nanoscale manufacturing."

Sullivan snorted. "Sure you did, kiddo. Where is it, then?"

Xavier left the stable without responding. Sullivan had touched a nerve. Truth be told, he'd been mentally skirting around his original goal for months. Looking back at his idea now, it seemed so naive that he almost couldn't believe he'd thought it. As if democratizing access to nanoscale manufacturing wouldn't have any unintended consequences, when there were people like Sullivan in the world. The thought of the horrors Sullivan could manifest creeped him to the core.

It hadn't escaped his notice that their recapture of the Terrarium was made possible by a single factor: Technological superiority. It was this that had allowed the Anarchists to build the weapons, escape the lab, and distribute their forces. Without it, they would have been stuck in the lab and eventually overwhelmed when the statists received reinforcements.

Xavier had no hope that the Anarchists could ever outnumber the statists. The relative population sizes of the PR and the Anarchy made this starkly clear - when given a choice between earning one's own place in the world and living large on ill-gotten gains appropriated by a faceless monopoly of violent coercion, almost everyone chose the latter. And why wouldn't they? When there's a gang out there, robbing Peter to pay Paul, it takes a special kind of person to choose to be Peter regardless. Those were Xavier's people.

His people needed to level the playing field, and for the first time in history, they could. In fact, they could do a great deal more than that.

They could sink the PR into the sea. They could nuke every capital city on the planet. They could fill the world with billions of minuscule eavesdropping assassin-drones, ready to deliver a fatal stroke to anyone who ever mentioned "income redistribution". They could become as evil as the statists themselves.

Or, they could leave. Leave before the statists fully realized what he had. Leave while they still could - for if a state ever got ahold of the terrifying power of the ASIC, no threat to their dominance would ever be allowed to emerge again. Freedom would be well and truly over.

Xavier looked up to the sky. Surface-to-air missiles could reach altitudes of 45km - twice as high as the Terrarium. Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles could fly even higher. Floating up into the stratosphere wasn't enough - they needed to go to space.

"What do you think?" Xavier asked Theo, gesturing through the glass wall of the wheelhouse at the frozen tundra below. In the wake of his rescue and Vincent's passing, Theo had taken up a grandfatherly role to Xavier and often followed him around, dispensing wisdom, especially when Xavier didn't want it.

"I think it looks like a frozen hellscape," responded Theo. "You said there was carbon?"

Getting to space was hard. In the interim, Xavier needed somewhere to build. Antarctica sufficed. Beneath the Transarctic Mountains, lay an abundant trove of carbon - in the form of pristine coal deposits. Mining of this coal was prohibited by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, but Xavier didn't remember signing it. If anyone objected, he reasoned, they were welcome to come to the frozen wasteland and plead their case.

"Yes, apparently there are stacks of the stuff in the Beacon Supergroup. We're almost there."

"Keep your eyes peeled!" Theo advised. "Coal is black."

Xavier thanked Theo for his valuable contribution, and continue piloting the Terrarium through the frozen mountains, looking for black.

Eventually, a promising black seam was located in the side of a mountain. One of his men volunteered to investigate, and returned shortly thereafter, reporting that the seam was indeed coal, and also that their new home was "colder than Viking hell."

Xavier docked the Terrarium next to the seam, and got to work.

Terraforming the valley adjacent to the mountain turned out to be relatively easy. He programmed the ASIC to encase the valley in an enormous dome, made of the same glassy carbon as the Terrarium walls. He and his crew then deployed an army of robots, armed with drills and fusion-powered heaters, to melt the ice and warm the ground. His crew, by now experts in transforming barren landscapes into lush rainforests, took it from there. Within a few weeks, the valley, now a comfortable twenty-two degrees celsius, was lush with turf and mature fruit trees, transplanted from the great nurseries and arboretums of the Anarchy.

Thousands of Xavier's people voluntarily relocated to the valley. The Anarchy was abuzz with a level of excitement unseen since its founding. Xavier was grateful for their help - without access to the MHI-10, the necessary advances in technology would have to be achieved with raw human intelligence and relentless experimentation.

At first, Xavier refused to build another ASIC. Paranoid of statist infiltration, he personally reviewed each and every CAD design before it was printed. Before long, he was spending twenty hours per day staring at his monitor, and still found himself unable to keep up with the experiments that his people wanted to run. Eventually, he relented. He manufactured another ASIC and placed it under Theo's supervision, thus attempting to kill two birds with one stone - cutting his CAD review volume in half, and keeping Theo out of his hair.

Unfortunately, the latter bird was more energized than defeated by the stone of responsibility and spent much of the day revelling in his newly elevated status by bothering Xavier.

"What do you think of this design?" he asked.

Xavier looked over at Theo's monitor. "Neodymium-infused carbon lattice," he responded. "Probably magnetic, but I'd bet it doesn't beat magnetite. Worth a shot though."

"Could it be a statist plot?" asked Theo.

Xavier looked at the old man incredulously, and questioned his own judgement in putting Theo in charge of the second ASIC.

"No," he replied. "This is just basic materials science."

Eventually, Theo got better at recognizing things that weren't statist plots - or, rather, got sloppier in evaluating designs for subterfuge. Either way, he bothered Xavier less and Xavier was much happier for it, particularly as not a single legitimate statist plot had been found.

After some weeks, an interesting design appeared in the queue. By punching a minuscule nozzle in the magnetic shielding that confined the hydrogen of a fusion reactor, a group of reckless maniacs had designed a fusion rocket. It was theoretically powerful enough to accelerate a thousand kilograms of material to escape velocity while consuming less than twenty kilograms of hydrogen. The only major downside would be the many-kilometers-long death ray of high-energy particles and gamma rays that emanated from the rocket's tail. Statist plot to genocide the Anarchists with cancer and radiation poisoning? It couldn't be discounted. Xavier cautiously approved the design, and Theo set his ASIC to manufacture it.

Not wishing to irradiate their polar settlement, Xavier made the amateur rocket scientists float the test vehicle up high on a balloon before igniting the engine. The entire settlement gathered together to watch on giant screens as the rocket accelerated out of the atmosphere, followed presumably by the planet's gravity well, and the solar system. It ultimately would have left the galaxy altogether, had interstellar space actually existed - in reality, the fusion engine disappeared as soon as it hit the bounding box surrounding the solar system.

With renewed energy, Xavier let Theo take over all review and manufacturing responsibilities and returned to design work.

Within a month, the design was ready for orbit. One after another, hundreds of fusion rockets were floated and launched into an evenly spaced orbit, in line with the plane of the solar system, a couple hundred kilometers above the planet's surface. The payload of each rocket was a nano-fabrication suite, programmed to extrude a chain of colossal carbon tubes, each impregnated - as Xavier had suspected - with magnetite. Once in orbit, each factory constructed over a hundred kilometers of chain. Thrusters on the tail of each chain coordinated with the rocket on the head of the next, each snaking and winding through space and and mating with its neighbours until every section of chain was welded together. The result was an enormous carbon/iron ouroboros encircling the planet, orbiting at eight kilometers per second.

Once the orbital ring was fully connected, a magnetically levitating shuttle was attached to it, with a coiled tether long enough to reach all the way back down to the stratosphere. They called it the sling-on-a-ring.

After successfully testing the sling-on-a-ring by flinging a couple hundred communications satellites into orbit, Xavier was confident enough to perform the first manned launch. His vehicle resembled a single-seat fighter jet with a fusion rocket on the back. He attached it to a balloon and floated it forty kilometers into the air, riding the air currents until he was under the ring.

"Approaching pickup zone, decelerating the shuttle now," came Theo's voice over the radio.

"Roger that," Xavier replied.

"How you feeling?" Theo asked, abandoning the radio script.

Xavier wished he hadn't asked. He was nervous at the prospect of being flung into space in an experimental vehicle, but would rather die in a vacuum than admit his feelings over the radio.

"Ready to roll," he responded.

Although Theo had said "decelerating the shuttle", that was only how it seemed to the balloon. A hundred and sixty kilometers above Xavier, on the orbital ring, decelerating relative to Earth involved burning obscene amounts of energy to accelerate in the opposite direction to the ring's orbit. Two fusion reactors on the shuttle came online and started blasting huge pulse waves of power through superconductive coils, and the shuttle began to move.

"Negative one kilometer per second," read out Theo over the radio. "Negative two," he followed up, a few moments later.

As Theo counted down, Xavier wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans. He'd considered building a space-suit, but it had seemed unnecessary at the time. Feeling much less confident now, he prayed that nothing went wrong that would require him to leave the craft.

"Negative seven point five, releasing tether."

Xavier closed his eyes and pictured the long carbon rope spiralling down through the atmosphere, guided towards the balloon by an active control system. By releasing it while the shuttle was still moving, the system imparted a gentle pendulum-like arc on the tether, which made its descent more predictable and easier to control.

"Terminal velocity, negative eight kilometers per second. Tether should be reaching you any second now."

Xavier heard a _clunk_, as the electromagnetic hook on the end of the tether attached itself to the nose of his space-jet.

"Successful attachment. Prepare for launch."

Xavier held on to the arms of his chair and felt a sickening drop as the space-jet was released from the balloon, followed by a hard jerk as the tether taughtened. Up above him, the shuttle started to move again. This time, it braked itself against the rotating magnetic field of the orbital ring, and thus began its acceleration relative to the planet.

The shuttle braked harder and harder against the orbital ring, which accelerated Xavier's plane faster and faster. As the centrifugal force on the plane slowly lifted it out of the atmosphere and towards the orbital ring, Theo switched from reading out the velocity of the shuttle to reading out his altitude.

"Fifty kilometers," he read. "Sixty."

When he reached two hundred, Xavier felt a gentle lateral nudge as the active control system avoided colliding with the ring. For a brief moment as he floated by, Xavier's windscreen was dominated by the view of the gigantic carbon hoop. Although he knew that he, the ring, and the shuttle were all orbiting at 8 kilometers per second, the entire system seemed almost still.

The shuttle didn't stop accelerating when it reached orbital velocity. It kept going, this time in the same direction as the ring, and Xavier was pulled outwards by the centrifugal force. The earth rose into his field of view, and before long, he was dangling upside-down, pointing back to Earth, ready to be released towards any target in the solar system. As he reached the maximum altitude the tether would allow, Theo switched back to reading out his velocity.

"Eleven point two kilometers per second," came his grandfatherly voice over the radio. "Escape velocity."

"Keep going," Xavier responded.

Once the plane had risen to its maximum extent above the ring, nothing much changed in Xavier's experience as the shuttle continued its acceleration. Barring relativistic phenomena, the main upper bound to his velocity was the amount of time he could withstand the g-forces. Once Theo read out sixteen kilometers per second, he decided he'd had enough.

"That's fast enough," he said. "Release me."

"Confirm, release payload?" Theo asked in mock-military radio lingo.

"Roger. Release payload."

The sling released him at 16 kilometers per second, in the direction of Jupiter. Xavier immediately felt his weight disappear, and though he was traveling many times faster than he'd ever experienced on Earth, it still felt slow. The Earth continued to dominate his visual field as he floated away from it, traveling well in excess of escape velocity but still a snail's pace relative to the size of space. As Xavier floated against his flight harness, he did some mental math. At his current velocity, he should reach Jupiter in around a year and a half.

A fun prospect, but he had work to do on Earth. Plus, his space-jet was totally unequipped to keep him alive that long. He didn't even have a toilet.

"Activating rocket, 1g acceleration," he announced. He opened the throttle and was pushed back into his chair. While weightlessness had been an interesting, novel experience, he felt much more comfortable under the familiar acceleration he'd experienced his whole life. It felt like he was lying on the couch, playing a video game projected on the ceiling.

With a twitch of the joystick, Xavier's comfort ended. He discovered that, while straight-line acceleration had been dialled in perfectly, the space-jet's yaw/pitch/roll control needed work. His attempt to rotate the ship had sent the craft spinning and tumbling chaotically through space, like a rapidly deflating balloon. He tried for a few seconds to right the ship while being pummelled against his seat and harness by the force of the rocket, before giving up and closing the throttle.

"Oof. That was bad. I'm gonna need some assistance," he announced over the radio.

No response came.

"Earth, come in," he said.

Silence.

"Theo, are you there? Please respond," he pleaded.

The horror of his situation dawned on him. In the chaos, the craft's antennae had lost their lock on the communications satellites. They were probably now randomly scanning through space with little hope of regaining a connection. If he wanted to live, Xavier would have to fix the control system by himself.

He closed his eyes and pulled up a mental model of the gyroscopes, thrusters, and software that worked together to steer the craft. Although there were large gaps in his understanding where other engineers had helped him out, Xavier suspected that the problems lay in his own code. He had fallen into the habit of educatedly-guessing mathematical constants ("PID gains") and relying on the atmosphere to dampen out any imprecision. This, it turned out, was what his dad would have called "Fisher-Price engineering". Out here in space, he actually had to get his math right.

Every time he opened his eyes, the spinning universe made him nauseous. He kept his eyes clamped shut to block out the visual chaos - the evolutionary cues to his brainstem that he'd eaten something highly hallucinogenic and had a choice between vomiting it out or dying from poison. As he weightlessly tumbled away from his planet and into the cold depths of space, he desperately tried to remember how to solve differential equations before the call of nature forced him to fill his tiny living space with vomit or excrement.
