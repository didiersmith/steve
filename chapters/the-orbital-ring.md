## 0. The Orbital Ring

Hundreds of thousands of Xavier's people relocated to the Antarctic valley. The Anarchy was abuzz with a level of excitement unseen since its founding. Xavier was grateful for their help - without access to the MHI-10, the necessary advances in technology would have to be achieved with raw human intelligence and relentless experimentation.

It was a shame, Xavier thought, that their home in Antarctica was only temporary. It was a good staging area - relatively isolated, lots of carbon. They made it feel like home. But it couldn't be their forever home. 

Nor could the skies. The Terrarium was a neat invention, but it was indefensible. Plus, there were no resources in the sky.

No. In the long run, if his people wanted to be safe from the statists, there was simply nowhere on Earth for them to live.

If they wanted to be free, they had to leave. They had to go to space.

The voices in his head reminded him of this fact, constantly.

Paranoid of statist infiltration, Xavier personally reviewed each and every CAD design before it was sent to the ASIC for manufacture. Before long, he was spending twenty hours per day staring at his monitor. He became a one-man bottleneck for the innovative output of the entire Anarchist technical community. But slowly, his hard work began to pay off.

After some weeks, an interesting design appeared in the queue. By punching a minuscule nozzle in the magnetic shielding that confined the hydrogen of a fusion reactor, a group of reckless maniacs had designed a fusion rocket. It was theoretically powerful enough to accelerate a thousand kilograms of material to escape velocity while consuming less than twenty kilograms of hydrogen. The only major downside would be the many-kilometers-long death ray of high-energy particles and gamma rays that emanated from the rocket's tail. Statist plot to genocide the Anarchists with cancer and radiation poisoning? It couldn't be discounted. Xavier cautiously approved the design, and sent it to the ASIC for manufacture.

Not wishing to irradiate their polar settlement, Xavier made the amateur rocket scientists float the test vehicle up high on a balloon before igniting the engine. The entire settlement gathered together to watch on giant screens as the rocket accelerated out of the atmosphere, followed presumably by the planet's gravity well, and the solar system.

"Not bad," said one of the voices in his head. "Certainly a necessary pre-requisite. But we asked for a ring."

With renewed vigour, Xavier re-immersed himself in design work. The Gods wanted a ring, eh? They'd get a ring.

Xavier and his team slaved away for weeks and weeks. He spent so much time in CAD that he began to forget what it meant to be human. He was a machine. No, he wasn't - he was a cog in a machine. A coroutine in a hideously complex piece of organic software, created for a single purpose: To design nanoscale-manufacturable megastructures.

Eventually, the design was ready. Xavier collapsed in his chair and slept for sixteen hours.

The next day, the settlement gathered again. This time, they were to witness the greatest human accomplishment in history.

One after another, hundreds of fusion rockets were attached to balloons and floated high into the atmosphere. Then, the sky lit up with brilliant lights as it was sliced up by the rockets igniting and propelling themselves into orbit.

Xavier didn't join the outdoor watch party. He stayed in his office, watching the launch on his screen.

"It's going to work," he told the voices in his head.

"I believe in you," one of the voices replied. It sounded a lot like his dad.

He stared intently at his screen as the display showed the rockets entering into an evenly spaced orbit around the planet, a couple hundred kilometers above the surface. Once the orbits stabilized, a previously greyed-out button activated on his screen.

It was labelled, "BUILD RING."

Xavier clicked the button.

Hundreds of kilometers above his head, each rocket split open to release its payload. Each rocket held a nano-fabrication factory, programmed to extrude a magnetite-impregnated chain of colossal carbon tubes. Each factory began constructing over a hundred kilometers of chain. Over the next few hours, thrusters on the tail of each chain coordinated with the rocket on the head of the next, each snaking and winding through space and and mating with its neighbours until every section of chain was welded together. The result was an enormous carbon/iron ouroboros encircling the planet, orbiting at eight kilometers per second.

"You happy?" Xavier asked the Gods.

"Not bad," one of them replied. "But let's see if it works."

Xavier sighed. Sixteen hours of sleep hadn't been enough - he was still exhausted. But, unless his screen was lying to him, he was almost done.

Another button had activated on his screen. "TEST SHUTTLE."

Xavier clicked the button.

Hundreds of kilometers above him, on the orbital ring, a fusion reactor started up. It was on a shuttle, and powered a set of superconducting magnets. As the shuttle pulsed its magnetic field, it started to move.

Xavier watched on his display as the shuttle accelerated itself harder and harder against the ring, until it was stationary relative to the earth. Clicking a couple more buttons, Xavier watched as his display flashed "RELEASING TETHER".

A two-hundred-kilometer-long carbon rope started dropping from the shuttle.

The rope snaked its way through the atmosphere, guided by an active control system. After fifteen minutes of freefall, it slowed down and attached itself to a communications satellite, which was hovering in the atmosphere, attached to a balloon. As Xavier clicked a couple more buttons, the shuttle began to move again.

He and his crew called their invention the sling-on-a-ring. As the shuttle moved along the radius of the orbital ring, it pulled the communications satellite away from the balloon. Xavier kicked the shuttle into maximum acceleration (labelled as 'DECELERATE' on the screen, as all commands were relative to the ring). The fusion reactor burned as much hydrogen as it could without overheating, and the shuttle ripped along the circumference of the ring, dragging the satellite out of the atmosphere.

A few minutes later, Xavier clicked one last button - "RELEASE". The tether released the satellite and it continued its upwards trajectory.

Xavier nodded, satisfied. With a few small adjustments, the satellite would reach a fairly satisfactory geostationary orbit. If he'd held on a few more minutes, it would have hit escape velocity. Not bad for a test run.

"Pretty good," said a voice in his head. "Now it's your turn."
