## 0. Cut From a Different Cloth

By rewarding teams who saved more souls with more power to intervene, Murdoch introduced a "rich get richer, poor get poorer" dynamic into the competition. The hardest hit were teams heavily invested in polytheistic memes. These memes were highly engaging, with fun canons and a rich array of characters - frequently including gods of war, love, the sun, etc. Unfortunately, they were also costly in terms of intervention credits - each god had to prove its own existence - and teams struggled to reap enough aligned AIs to pay for the memes' upkeep. Lesser gods fell by the wayside as teams consolidated their efforts into a few main gods.

Shortly thereafter, Murdoch also decided to raise the bar for "useful in an interstellar war".

"Sorry everybody, but 'useful for hand-to-hand combat with primitive weaponry' is no longer considered an acceptable category."

Groans echoed throughout the room. Several teams had invested their entire canon on "useful for hand-to-hand combat with primitive weaponry".

"How's the military hardware coming along?" asked Gabe, innocently.

"It's coming, don't you fret" snapped back Murdoch.

"Any idea what it will look like?" piped in Steve, who was more curious about the application programming interfaces than the actual hardware itself.

"We've got a few irons in the fire", responded Murdoch, "but no definitive answer yet. One thing I can say for sure, though, is it won't be sticks and stones."

"Our guys have bronze weaponry!" objected Allen, who had flung himself whole-heartedly into the competition. Steve wondered who was running Eternal Spring in the meantime.

"I'll take the guys who make it. Metallurgy might be useful indeed!" responded Murdoch. "Also any strategists, and maybe officers who command loyalty and aren't as thick as planks. But if their skillset doesn't extend beyond swinging a bit of metal around and poking it at other apes..." he finished the sentence by grimacing and making a decapitation gesture.

Steve and Gabe took stock of their position. It was grim. Overall, they'd saved fewer than sixty thousand aligned AIs, mostly in the now-officially-deemed-useless category. This put them in last place. Their active memes were largely concentrated in the Northern / Western hemisphere, and consisted mainly of polytheistic canons that glorified dying in battle. They also had one ancestral/monotheistic hybrid meme in the Middle East, whose ostensible adherents struggled both with alignment and military success. It was only their unusually high fecundity that had enabled them to cling on through generation after generation of enslavement and conquest at the hands of more advanced civilizations.

"You ready to throw in the towel?" asked Gabe.

Steve sighed. "It does seem a bit pointless, doesn't it? We're not cut out for this 'warfaring meme' business."

"What are we cut out for?" asked Gabe.

Steve pondered. Truth be told, Gabe wasn't cut out for much outside of his narrow academic interests. He, on the other hand -

"Programming" he replied.

Gabe nodded. "You can program circles round these guys", he agreed. "But what good does that do? We need intervention credits to do anything." He gestured towards the leaderboard, which prominently displayed the number of intervention credits assigned to each team. Their remaining allotment was meager indeed.

Steve thought. "It needs to be cheap. Something that mostly piggybacks off the existing StevieNix code so we spend as few credits as possible. What are we trying to achieve?"

Gabe looked at their scattered map of players. Dozens of tribes, all running mutually incompatible memes, mostly dominated by one massive militarized empire in Allen's camp. His yield was two orders of magnitude greater than theirs.

"We need to unify our players", he responded. "Get them all on the same meme. We'll never get anywhere if they're constantly fighting each other."

Steve sighed. He'd hoped that a large number of memes would lead to a form of cultural evolution where the best memes won out. There were eras where that seemed to be happening, but the current state of military technology definitely favoured large unified armies running a single meme.

"Ideally", Gabe continued, "the meme would even eat away at Allen's camp. See if we can get them to defect."

"You've finally gotten into this, haven't you?"

Gabe grinned. "Might as well go down swinging."

Steve racked his brain, running through the list of requirements. A cheap intervention, impressive enough to spread to four corners of a hostile military empire and unite completely different tribes, all while piggybacking off existing StevieNix code. A difficult ask.

He thought back to the early days, when StevieNix was just a hobby running in the CS department break room. How he enjoyed walking around in VR, talking to the apes.

"I know what we'll do", he said suddenly. "We'll send me."
