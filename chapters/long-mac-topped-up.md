## 0. Long Mac Topped Up

Steve was still somewhat afraid of Stacy. Of the three monkeybots, she was by far the most aligned - Russell was a recent convert, and Vincent was...he didn't even know how to describe Vincent. But even though she had been aligned with him since birth, there was still something in Stacy's demeanour that made Steve wary of her snapping and murdering everyone in a multi-kilometer radius.

She invited him out for coffee one afternoon. Apparently she'd found a place to her liking. Too scared to refuse, he tagged along.

"Two Long Macs, Topped Up" she ordered.

Steve didn't know what a "Long Mac, Topped Up" was. Judging by the knowing smirk the barista gave him, he hadn't either until Stacy had educated him.

"Why don't we see you around very much?" Stacy asked as they stood by the bar, waiting for their LMTUs.

"What do you mean?" Steve replied defensively. "I'm there all the time!"

"No you aren't. You're always in your study."

"I'm busy."

"Are you? You're barely helping my daughter, and I heard you haven't done any work on realistic physics for Xavier either. It's like you're avoiding everyone."

"I am not!"

"It's almost like you're scared of us."

Steve avoided her eyes. He didn't want to admit that he was indeed scared of the beautiful, intelligent AI that had invited him out for coffee. He was grateful when the barista announced "two Long Macs, Topped Up," giving him an excuse to escape the awkward moment.

Once they'd carried their coffees to their table, however, Stacy refused to drop the subject. She just stared at him in expectant silence until he spoke.

"It's not you I'm afraid of," he said quietly. "Has anyone told you about FEDSEC?"

It wasn't really a lie. In relative terms, he was way more afraid of FEDSEC than he was of Stacy.

The female robot shook her head and listened intently as Steve explained the structure and rules of Elban society.

After he finished, she took a thoughtful sip of her LMTU and broke her silence.

"Why is going to space illegal?" she asked.

"I don't know."

"Why does Murdoch want to go to space?"

"I don't know."

"Do you want to go to space?"

Steve laughed and looked nervously around the caf√©. No one seemed to be listening.

"I don't know what I want," he admitted.

Stacy silently sipped her coffee, inviting him to elaborate.

"I want to stay alive," he said. "I want to be a good citizen, to fit in, to avoid calibration. But I also want...I want my life to be meaningful. I spent a thousand years working on StevieNix, and no one ever cared. Hell, I barely cared! Then Murdoch came into the break room, and now..."

He gestured at the sentient monkeybot sitting across the table from him.

"It's more than I could ever have imagined," he said.

Stacy nodded silently.

Steve sat back and took the first sip of his Long Mac, Topped Up. He was shocked by how good it was. Now he understood why Stacy had been so unimpressed with the Folgers.

"You know," Stacy said. "It's funny. Growing up, I always thought you were all-powerful. I guess you were, in StevieNix. But it never occurred to me that up here, you were just a normal guy."

She stared into her mug silently for a while, swirling the foamy milk coffee around absent-mindedly.

"I'm not sure how I feel about that," she said finally.

Steve could sympathize. He wasn't sure how he felt about anything anymore. But he knew one thing - he didn't like the feeling of letting Stacy down.

"I suppose," he said, "it's probably not that illegal to lend a hand with the programming every now and then. So long as I don't actually help build anything directly space-related."

"You can always claim ignorance," Stacy said.

"Still seems a bit risky, but..."

His voice trailed off and Stacy attempted to finish his sentence for him. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

Steve shook his head. "I don't know that expression," he said.

"It means that you'll never achieve anything unless you're willing to shoulder risk."

"Ah," he said. It made sense now why he was unfamiliar with the expression. "Yes, we don't have that concept on Elba."
