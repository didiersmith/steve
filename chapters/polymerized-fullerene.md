# 28. Polymerized fullerene

The trio reached the Swan River at 4am. When they arrived at the sandy shoreline, Vincent took out his phone and spoke into his app, "okay, build the boat."

The sand in front of them rippled like waves, as the billions of robots that had been following them through the tunnel network emerged, piecing together individual carbon atoms into an unfathomably complex lattice of carbon nanotubes that made sense only to the LLM. Ribs began to take shape, before being hidden behind a perfectly smooth skin of carbon fiber. A figurehead of Steve's terrestrial avatar took shape on the prow, adorned with a diamond crown of thorns.

In a few minutes, the boat was done. It resembled a mastless, carbon cross between a Viking warship and a Thai long-tail boat. They pushed it into the river and climbed aboard.

Vincent fired up the fusion engine and lowered the oversized propeller into the water. The boat accelerated with a jolt, and Russell and Stacy were thrown to the floor in surprise. As the ultralight craft skimmed over the water, jostling its occupants port and starboard, Stacy objected.

"You couldn't have designed a more stable boat?"

"This boat is history in the making," Vincent responded. "What's a couple hours of discomfort in exchange for an eternity of style?"

"I'm going to be sick."

"We'll leave that part out of the history books."

"Can't you at least add a keel?" complained Russell.

"We don't have any robots," pointed out Vincent. "Can't change anything until we get there."

Stacy and Russell groaned and lay down in the bottom of the boat as a grinning Vincent guided them at top speed past the Perth skyline, out the mouth of the Swan, and into international waters.

"We're here!" Vincent announced.

Russell blinked and sat up. Against all odds, he had managed to fall asleep. He looked over at Stacy. She looked rough. Bleary-eyed, hair matted with vomit, and clearly very annoyed. He was freezing. "Did you sleep?" he asked.

"Screw off," she answered.

Russell hoisted himself up and looked around. The sun was just breaking over the Eastern horizon. Other than that, all he could see was ocean and sky. The boat bobbed gently in the waves. Russell sighed and let himself collapse back into the bottom of the boat.

"You're gonna want to watch this," said Vincent.

Russell and Stacy reluctantly made their way to the port side of the boat, where Vincent was indicating. Russell couldn't see anything but the sea. He was about to say something, when Stacy yelled, "look!"

He looked where she was pointing and saw a large black cylinder, roughly a meter in diameter, slowly rising from the surface of the water. It appeared to be made from the same material as the boat. His annoyance and seasickness disappeared. "Whoa," he said.

When it had reached a height of two meters above the surrounding sea, it stopped rising. Everything was still for a moment, and then a couple of spurts of water came out the top. All of a sudden, a jet of water blasted out of the cylinder, soaring way overhead.

"Oh frig!" yelled Vincent, and started the fusion engine. He plunged the propeller back into the water and Russell and Stacy were once again thrown to the bottom of the boat as it accelerated away from the enormous fountain of seawater.

They didn't quite make it. The water came crashing down, knocking the air out of everyone's lungs. Vincent was thrown from his perch at the stern of the boat, landing in the bottom next to the other two. The engine's safety cutoff activated, and the boat continued to coast on its momentum and the chaotic force of the falling water until it was thankfully forced out of the fountain's landing zone.

Out of the landing zone, but not out of danger. The three continued to cling on for dear life. The boat was spinning, pitching, and rolling every which way on the turbulent sea.

"Don't worry!" Vincent attempted to reassure the others. "It's unsinkable!"

Russell couldn't hear Stacy's shouted response over the sound of the thundering water crashing back down into the ocean, but understood her obscene hand gestures.

After what felt like an eternity, the fountain abruptly stopped. The battered trio took stock. They were soaked and bruised to the bone, and the boat was half filled with water.

Stacy spoke up. "You absolute sodding moron!" she spat at Vincent. "You useless sack of-"

"Whoa!" shouted Russell, cutting her off and pointing back to the cylinder. "What's that?"

Huge volumes of white foam were spilling out of the top, overflowing like a tapped beer bottle, and disappearing into the sea below. Vincent breathed a sigh of relief. "It's working!" he exclaimed.

"It'd better work, you complete and utter dropkick!"

Vincent started the engine and maneuvered the flooded boat closer to the cylinder. Minutes elapsed as the foam continued to spill out and vanish into the sea. The trio shivered. Russell was beginning to regret not having brought a wetsuit - the sun was still barely up, and the water was seriously cold.

Soon, the shivering turned into shaking. Russell looked at his compatriots. Stacy had given up trying to find a stable perch above the waterline, and was slumped against the wall of the boat, half submerged, arms wrapped around her legs, skin grey, lips blue. Vincent didn't look much better - his teeth were chattering uncontrollably and he appeared to have lost his final shred of enthusiasm. It dawned on Russell that, if Vincent's plan didn't come to fruition in the next few minutes, death by hypothermia would result.

He pulled the Starlink transceiver out of the waterproof pouch inside his jacket, and turned it on. It would take some time to connect to the satellites, and time was in short supply. As he watched the LEDs flash, his vision began to fade. The boat turned blurry, and the sea beneath them faded from deep blue to white.

The boat jolted. Some heroic gland deep within Russell managed to muster his single remaining drop of adrenaline and squeeze it into his bloodstream. He lifted his head. The sea wasn't white. The boat was on dry land.

"Wake up!" he yelled at the other two.

"Grmmmm" moaned Stacy. Russell sloshed over to her, put his shoulder under her armpit, and heaved her up. He wasn't strong enough to fireman-carry her out of the boat, but as soon as her face crested the side and she saw what lay beyond, she regained sufficient strength to haul herself over the edge and collapse onto the ground.

Russell looked around for Vincent. He found him crouched on all four, examining the pure white ground, hacking, coughing, and cackling.

"Polymerized fullerene", he stammered. "Thank God it actually sticks together."

Thank God indeed, thought Russell.

The Starlink transceiver beeped. It had found a satellite. Russell pulled his phone out of the waterproof pouch, and opened the LLM app.

"Please make us a heat source," he pleaded.

A campfire appeared in front of him on the polymerized fullerene ground. Vincent crawled towards it. Russell dragged Stacy's barely-conscious body over, flopped down next to his two friends, and passed out. Mission accomplished.

Steve and Gabe looked up from the screen. "Can we heal them?" asked Steve.

"Can't. A hundred percent of our credits are going to Allen," responded Gabe.

"Frig. They look pretty rough."

"They'll make it. These apes are pretty hardy."

"Do you have any idea what their plan is?" asked Steve.

"No, I thought you did!" responded Gabe.

"I thought they were going to make a bible course! Maybe a matchmaking service! This," Steve gestured at the screen, "is insane."

Gabe burst out laughing. "You gave these monkeys an omniscient supercomputer, and you thought they'd make a bible course? Dude, how long have you been locked in that datacenter?"

Steve turned back to the screen and watched the three apes shivering in front of the campfire. Eventually, he started laughing too. He had no idea where this was going, but it sure was entertaining.
