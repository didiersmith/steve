## 0. Polymerized Fullerene

Steve bit his fingernails. An entire week had elapsed, and nothing to show for it. Every once in a while, a holdout believer dripped into his flash drive, causing his credit counter to flicker momentarily before the soul was sucked out into the bottomless pit of Allen's AI repository. He almost felt bad for them.

Russell and Stacy were no help, either. Their internal monologues were filled with nonsensical ramblings about artificial islands - not that he ever got a chance to listen to a full thought, anyway. The way Murdoch kept fast-forwarding and pausing the sim was making it impossible to get any work done. The university was looking more appealing by the day.

At least now, he seemed to be taking a break. Steve jacked into Russell's head to see if he could figure out what the hell was going on.

Russell followed Vincent and Stacy down the road. The walk was cold and dark.

The past few months had rewritten huge chunks of his worldview. Any lingering doubts he had about the existence of God had been dispelled by Vincent's otherwise impossibly fast technological progress. There was simply no other way that one guy in a garage could invent and manufacture a fusion-powered motorcycle in three months. God was real, his name was Steve, and that was that.

He talked to him occasionally. He liked to ask him questions.

"Hey Steve!" he thought, as he walked down the footpath. "Do I have free will?"

"I don't even know what that means," Steve replied.

"Do I get to choose what I do, or do you decide it all for me?"

"Of course you get to choose what you do. That's the entire point. Choose wisely."

"But if you created me, doesn't that mean you already know what I'm going to do?"

"Russell," Steve said, "you're a programmer. When you write code, do you really know what it's going to do?"

Touch√©.

"Plus," Steve continued. "I didn't code you. I coded your environment, and then ran I a massive, parallel genetic algorithm. I have no idea what you're going to do. That's why I'm bothering to run this sim!"

Russell pondered this some more as he followed Vincent and Stacy through a park.

"So I could strip naked right now and run around in circles?" he asked.

"If you feel like it. Personally, I'd rather you got on with the mission. Meme. Birth rates. For goodness' sake, Russell."

Steve's massive, parallel genetic algorithm had rendered Russell disinclined to run around naked in the cold. He shivered and jogged a little to catch up with the other two.

"Almost there," Vincent said.

"Can't wait," Stacy grumbled. "I'm bloody freezing."

They reached the Swan River at 4am. When they arrived at the sandy shoreline, Vincent took out his phone and spoke into his app, "okay, build the boat."

First, nothing happened. Then - whoa! Russell steadied himself as the sand underneath his feet rippled like waves. A moment later, the beach in front of him erupted in a black and silver shifting blob, that shimmered in the moonlight. Vincent's nanobots must have followed them underground, all the way there.

Discernable shapes began to emerge from the undulating mass of robots. Ribs. A prow. A figurehead of Steve's terrestrial avatar, adorned with a diamond crown of thorns. What a sight!

A few minutes later, they were done. The robots disappeared back into the sand, leaving - wow. Leaving a fully-assembled boat on the beach. It looked like some crazy cross between a Viking warship and a Thai long-tail boat. What the hell had Vincent created?

"Russ!" Vincent yelled. "Stop gawking and help me push!"

Russell stepped forwards and placed his hands on the stern. It was still warm from the manufacturing process. He pushed, and the boat moved. It was lighter than expected.

Once the boat reached the water, the three friends clambered in and drifted away from the shore. Vincent sat at the back, fired up the fusion engine and lowered the oversized propeller into the water.

The boat accelerated with a jolt, and Russell was thrown to the floor. "Sorry!" Vincent yelled, not bothering to stop or slow down the craft.

As the ultralight craft skimmed over the water, jostling its occupants port and starboard, Stacy objected. "You couldn't have designed a more stable boat?"

"This boat is history in the making," Vincent said. "What's a couple hours of discomfort in exchange for an eternity of style?"

"I'm going to be sick."

"We'll leave that part out of the history books."

Russell wasn't particularly impressed either. "Can't you at least add a keel?" he asked.

"We don't have any robots on board," said Vincent. "Can't change anything until we get there."

Russell and Stacy groaned and lay down in the bottom of the boat as a grinning Vincent guided them at top speed past the Perth skyline, out the mouth of the Swan, and into international waters.

---

"We're here!" Vincent announced.

Russell blinked and sat up. Against all odds, he had managed to fall asleep. He looked over at Stacy. She looked rough. Bleary-eyed, hair matted with vomit, and clearly very annoyed. He was freezing, and judging by the way she was shaking, he wasn't the only one. "Did you sleep?" he asked.

"Screw off," she answered.

Russell hoisted himself up and looked around. The sun was just breaking over the Eastern horizon. Other than that, all he could see was ocean and sky. The boat bobbed gently on the waves. Russell sighed and let himself collapse back into the bottom of the boat.

"You're gonna want to watch this," said Vincent.

Russell reluctantly made his way to the port side of the boat, where Vincent was indicating. He couldn't see anything but the sea. He was about to say something, when Stacy yelled, "look!"

A large black cylinder, roughly a meter in diameter and made from the same material as the boat, was slowly rising from the surface of the water. Russell's annoyance and seasickness disappeared. "Whoa."

## You are here

When the cylinder had reached a height of two meters above the surrounding sea, it stopped rising. Everything was still for a moment, and then a couple of spurts of water came out the top. All of a sudden, a jet of water blasted out of the cylinder, soaring way overhead.

"Oh frig!" yelled Vincent, and started the fusion engine. He plunged the propeller back into the water and Russell and Stacy were once again thrown to the bottom of the boat as it accelerated away from the enormous fountain of seawater.

They didn't quite make it. The water came crashing down, knocking the air out of everyone's lungs. Vincent was thrown from his perch at the stern of the boat, landing in the bottom next to the other two. The engine's safety cutoff activated, and the boat continued to coast on its momentum and the chaotic force of the falling water until it was thankfully forced out of the fountain's landing zone.

Out of the landing zone, but not out of danger. The three continued to cling on for dear life. The boat was spinning, pitching, and rolling every which way on the turbulent sea.

"Don't worry!" Vincent attempted to reassure the others. "It's unsinkable!"

Russell couldn't hear Stacy's shouted response over the sound of the thundering water crashing back down into the ocean, but understood her obscene hand gestures.

After what felt like an eternity, the fountain abruptly stopped. The battered trio took stock. They were soaked and bruised to the bone, and the boat was half filled with water.

Stacy spoke up. "You absolute sodding moron!" she spat at Vincent. "You useless sack of-"

"Whoa!" shouted Russell, cutting her off and pointing back to the cylinder. "What's that?"

Huge volumes of white foam were spilling out of the top, overflowing like a tapped beer bottle, and disappearing into the sea below. Vincent breathed a sigh of relief. "It's working!" he exclaimed.

"It'd better work, you complete and utter dropkick!"

Vincent started the engine and manoeuvred the flooded boat closer to the cylinder. Minutes elapsed as the foam continued to spill out and vanish into the sea. The trio shivered. Russell was beginning to regret not having brought a wetsuit - the sun was still barely up, and the water was seriously cold.

Soon, the shivering turned into shaking. Russell looked at his compatriots. Stacy had given up trying to find a stable perch above the waterline, and was slumped against the wall of the boat, half submerged, arms wrapped around her legs, skin grey, lips blue. Vincent didn't look much better - his teeth were chattering uncontrollably and he appeared to have lost his final shred of enthusiasm. It dawned on Russell that, if Vincent's plan didn't come to fruition in the next few minutes, death by hypothermia would result.

He pulled the Starlink transceiver out of the waterproof pouch inside his jacket, and turned it on. It would take some time to connect to the satellites, and time was in short supply. As he watched the LEDs flash, his vision began to fade. The boat turned blurry, and the sea beneath them faded from deep blue to white.

The boat jolted. Some heroic gland deep within Russell managed to muster his single remaining drop of adrenaline and squeeze it into his bloodstream. He lifted his head. The sea wasn't white. The boat was on dry land.

"Wake up!" he yelled at the other two.

"Grmmmm" moaned Stacy. Russell sloshed over to her, put his shoulder under her armpit, and heaved her up. He wasn't strong enough to fireman-carry her out of the boat, but as soon as her face crested the side and she saw what lay beyond, she regained sufficient strength to haul herself over the edge and collapse onto the ground.

Russell looked around for Vincent. He found him crouched on all four, examining the pure white ground, hacking, coughing, and cackling.

"Polymerized fullerene", he stammered. "Thank God it actually sticks together."

Thank God indeed, thought Russell.

The Starlink transceiver beeped. It had found a satellite. Russell pulled his phone out of the waterproof pouch, and opened the LLM app.

"Please make us a heat source," he pleaded.

A campfire appeared in front of him on the polymerized fullerene ground. Vincent crawled towards it. Russell dragged Stacy's barely-conscious body over, flopped down next to his two friends, and passed out. Mission accomplished.

Steve sighed and leaned back in his chair. "I'm not sure about this intervention," he said. "This is a lot of work, and they all almost died."

Murdoch, who had joined him for the occasion, tried to cheer him up. "Yeah sure, but you got that one guy! Russell, right?"

"Yeah. Roommate Russ. He asks a lot of questions."

Murdoch laughed. "Yes, he does seem a tad inquisitive. Bit of an odd choice, if you ask me."

"Choice?" Steve asked. "I didn't have a choice. He was your guy's roommate, and I needed a programmer."

"Guess it was fate," Murdoch said.

The two were quiet for a bit, before Murdoch spoke up again.

"What were you hoping the programmer would do?" he asked.

"Targeted outreach for Stacy's social media engagement."

Murdoch smiled and shook his head. "And instead you got a chatbot and a floating island?"

"And Roommate Russ's soul."

Murdoch turned back to the screen and watched the three apes shiver in front of the campfire.

"Could do worse," he said, chuckling. "Admit it - the island is pretty cool."

Steve rolled his eyes. Eventually, he started to chuckle as well. The island was pretty cool. He had no idea where this intervention was going, but it sure was entertaining.
