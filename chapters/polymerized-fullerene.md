## 0. Polymerized Fullerene

Steve bit his fingernails. An entire week had elapsed, and nothing to show for it. Every once in a while, a holdout believer dripped into his flash drive, causing his credit counter to flicker momentarily before the soul was sucked out into the bottomless pit of Allen's AI repository. He almost felt bad for them.

Russell and Stacy were no help, either. Their internal monologues were filled with nonsensical ramblings about artificial islands - not that he ever got a chance to listen to a full thought, anyway. The way Murdoch kept fast-forwarding and pausing the sim was making it impossible to get any work done. The university was looking more appealing by the day.

At least now, he seemed to be taking a break. Steve jacked into Russell's head to see if he could figure out what the hell was going on.

Russell followed Vincent and Stacy down the road. The walk was cold and dark.

The past few months had rewritten huge chunks of his worldview. Any lingering doubts he had about the existence of God had been dispelled by Vincent's otherwise impossibly fast technological progress. There was simply no other way that one guy in a garage could invent and manufacture a fusion-powered motorcycle in three months. God was real, his name was Steve, and that was that.

He talked to him occasionally. He liked to ask him questions.

"Hey Steve!" he thought as he walked down the footpath. "Do I have free will?"

"I don't even know what that means," Steve replied.

"Do I get to choose what I do, or do you decide it all for me?"

"Of course you get to choose what you do. That's the entire point. Choose wisely."

"But if you created me, doesn't that mean you already know what I'm going to do?"

"Russell," Steve said, "you're a programmer. When you write code, do you really know what it's going to do?"

Touch√©.

"Plus," Steve continued. "I didn't code you. I coded your environment, and then ran I a massive, parallel genetic algorithm. I have no idea what you're going to do. That's why I'm bothering to run this sim!"

Russell pondered this some more as he followed Vincent and Stacy through a park.

"So I could strip naked right now and run around in circles?" he asked.

"If you feel like it. Personally, I'd rather you got on with the mission. Meme. Birth rates. For goodness' sake, Russell."

Steve's massive, parallel genetic algorithm had rendered Russell disinclined to run around naked in the cold. He shivered and jogged a little to catch up with the other two.

"Almost there," Vincent said.

"Can't wait," Stacy grumbled. "I'm bloody freezing."

They reached the Swan River at 4 in the morning. When they arrived at the sandy shoreline, Vincent took out his phone and spoke into his app, "okay, build the boat."

First, nothing happened. Then - whoa! Russell steadied himself as the sand underneath his feet rippled like waves. A moment later, the beach in front of him erupted in a black and silver shifting blob, that shimmered in the moonlight. Vincent's nanobots must have followed them underground, all the way there.

Discernable shapes began to emerge from the undulating mass of robots. Ribs. A prow. A figurehead of Steve's terrestrial avatar, adorned with a diamond crown of thorns. What a sight!

A few minutes later, they were done. The robots disappeared back into the sand, leaving - wow. Leaving a fully-assembled boat on the beach. It looked like some crazy cross between a Viking warship and a Thai long-tail boat. What the hell had Vincent created?

"Russ!" Vincent yelled. "Stop gawking and help me push!"

Russell stepped forwards and placed his hands on the stern. It was still warm from the manufacturing process. He pushed, and the boat moved. It was lighter than expected.

Once the boat reached the water, the three friends clambered in and drifted away from the shore. Vincent sat at the back, fired up the fusion engine and lowered the oversized propeller into the water.

The boat accelerated with a jolt, and Russell was thrown to the floor. "Sorry!" Vincent yelled, not bothering to stop or slow down the craft.

As the ultralight craft skimmed over the water, jostling its occupants port and starboard, Stacy objected. "You couldn't have designed a more stable boat?"

"This boat is history in the making," Vincent said. "What's a couple hours of discomfort in exchange for an eternity of style?"

"I'm going to be sick."

"We'll leave that part out of the history books."

Russell wasn't particularly impressed either. "Can't you at least add a keel?" he asked.

"Can't," said Vincent. "Robots don't swim. We can't change anything until we get there."

Russell and Stacy groaned and lay down in the bottom of the boat as a grinning Vincent guided them at top speed past the Perth skyline, out the mouth of the Swan, and into international waters.

---

"We're here!" Vincent announced.

Russell blinked and sat up - against all odds, he had managed to fall asleep. He was freezing, and judging by the way Stacy was shaking, so was she. Man, she looked rough. Bleary-eyed, hair matted with vomit..."Did you sleep?" he asked.

"Screw off," she answered.

Guess not. Russell hoisted himself up and looked over the side of the boat. The sun was just breaking over the Eastern horizon. Other than that, all he could see was ocean and sky. The boat bobbed gently on the waves. Russell drooped his head and began to slowly collapse back into the bottom of the boat.

"You're gonna want to watch this," said Vincent from the other side of the boat.

Ugh. Russell reluctantly wobbled his way across. "All I see is water."

"Look!" Stacy yelled.

He looked where she was pointing. Oh. How had he missed that? The robots were back. A shimmering black and silver mass around a meter in diameter, was emerging out of the sea.

The mass grew taller and taller, and before long, Russell could make out what they were building: A black cylinder.

"Our supply chain," Vincent explained, nodding at the cylinder. "Straight from the Earth's crust."

"Did the robots follow us here?" Stacy asked.

"We followed them. They've been tunneling here for weeks."

Russell looked out over the ocean. Other than the cylinder, there was nothing. No sign of life, land, palm trees, anything. Not even a seagull. "You sure about this?" he asked.

"Dead sure. Just wait until the pipe's done. The bots will push the seawater out, then we'll really start cooking."

Well, Vincent had gotten them this far. He'd earned a little trust.

The robots built upwards until the "supply chain" towered over the boat. Then, at once, the gleaming blob of nanobots slurped itself into the pipe as if they'd been vaccumed in, leaving just the perfect, black, one meter diameter cylinder sticking out of the water.

"Showtime." Vincent stared rapt at the cylinder.

Nothing happened. Russell looked at Stacy, who shrugged.

Then, a gurgle. A bit of seawater bubbled out the top.

"Hey hey!" Russell said.

Vincent shook his head. "Not yet."

The bubbling died down. A few seconds later, an enormous foundain of seawater blasted out of the cylinder - it must have been thirty, forty meters high.

"Oh frig!" yelled Vincent, and started the fusion engine. He plunged the propeller back into the water and Russell was once again thrown to the bottom of the boat as they jolted away from the looming tower of water.

They didn't quite make it. The water came crashing down like a piano, crushing Russell against the floor of the boat. The ribs of the boat smashed into the ribs of his body and punched the air out of his chest. This must be what a car accident feels like.

Russell gasped for breath, but instead of air, his lungs found seawater. It pummelled him, it surrounded him, it was drowning him. He coughed and hacked, but each time he inhaled - more seawater. His head knocked against something soft - Vincent. Who was driving the boat?

His lungs were empty. How long can you survive on the oxygen in your bloodstream? The world turned into a dark, spinning screensaver. Guess he'd find out. Bet it wasn't long.

Then, the water stopped falling. Russell's instincts somehow managed to lift his head out of the water and he finally inhaled air. He coughed, and seawater went up his nose.

"Stacy!" Vincent's voice was hoarse, like he'd been forced to eat a burning coal. He charge past Russell, towards - oh, shit.

Stacy was lying face-down in the water.

He flailed towards her and the two men hauled her upright. He held her limp body tightly as Vincent pummeled her back. Whack! Whack! Whack!

She stiffened and coughed. Whoa, that was a lot of water. She hacked and retched, but she was alive.

"You...dick!" she eventually managed at Vincent.

"Look behind you," he replied.

Russell lifted his head and looked behind her. The robots were back. The supply chain was overflowing with them.

The world was hazy. Russell struggled to keep his head up. It looked like the robots were building pipes. A capillary network, fanning out from the arterial cylinder, upwards and then sloping back down, eventually disappearing into the water beneath them.

Temporarily displaced by the adrenaline of almost drowning, the cold returned to Russell's bones - this time, with a vengeance. Had he ever been this cold before? He was beyond shivering, he was violently shaking.

White foam began pouring out of the pipes from all directions, like whipped cream being sprayed into a perforated hose. Was Vincent building the islands out of expanding foam?

Russell looked at Vincent. He looked like death. Slumped against the wall of the boat, eyes barely open, not even bothering to watch the magnificent display of nano-fabrication he'd spent months perfecting.

Stacy looked even worse. She'd given up trying to find a stable perch above the waterline and sat half-submerged in the freezing seawater, arms wrapped around her legs, skin grey, lips blue.

If Vincent's expanding-foam-island didn't pan out in the next few minutes, they'd all be dead from hypothermia. What if it did pan out? They'd probably die anyway, but this time, on an artificial island.

Russell pulled the Starlink transceiver out of the waterproof pouch inside his jacket, and turned it on. As he watched the LEDs flash, his vision began to fade. The boat turned blurry, and the sea brightened from deep blue to white.

The boat jolted. Russell lifted his head. Hang on - the sea hadn't faded to white. The boat was on dry land.

"Wake up!" he yelled at the other two.

"Grmmmm," moaned Stacy. Russell sloshed over to her, put his shoulder under her arm, and heaved her up. She was heavier than she looked. Fortunately, she regained a little strength and helped Russell haul her over the side of the boat and collapse onto the ground.

Now, where the hell was Vincent? He must have left the boat. Russell looked around and saw him crouched on all four, examining the pure white ground, hacking, coughing, and cackling. He climbed out of the boat and stumbled over to his friend.

"Polymerized fullerene," Vincent stammered. "Thank God it actually sticks together."

The Starlink transceiver beeped. It had found a satellite. Still shaking from the cold, Russell pulled his phone out of the waterproof pouch, and opened the LLM app.

"Please make us a heat source," he said.

A swarm of robots flowed to a spot on the ground next to them. They built a small black log-house structure, which stood still for a few moments before bursting into flames.

Heat. Oh, the heat. Russell moved closer to the orange flames of the dancing campfire. God, he needed this.

Vincent crawled towards the fire. Russell heard a cough behind him, and - oh, shit! He'd forgotten about Stacy!

He dragged her barely-conscious body next to the fire, flopped down next to his two friends, and passed out. Mission accomplished.

Steve grumbled a bit and looked up at Murdoch. "I'm not sure about this intervention," he said. "This is a lot of work, and they all almost died."

Murdoch tried to cheer him up. "Yeah sure, but you got that one guy! Russell, right?"

"Yeah. Roommate Russ. He asks a lot of questions."

Murdoch laughed. "Yes, he does seem a tad inquisitive. Bit of an odd choice, if you ask me."

"Choice?" Steve asked. "I didn't have a choice. He was your guy's roommate, and I needed a programmer."

"Guess it was fate, then."

The two were quiet for a bit, before Murdoch spoke up again.

"What were you hoping the programmer would do?" he asked.

"Targeted outreach for Stacy's social media engagement."

"And instead you got a floating island?"

Steve bit his tongue. The floating island was Murdoch's idea, he was sure of it.

Murdoch turned back to the screen and watched the three apes shiver in front of the campfire. "Could do worse," he said. "You have to admit, the island is pretty cool."

Steve rolled his eyes. The island was a huge distraction, and wasn't helping him get out of default at all. And now Stacy, his number one influencer, was trapped on it. His chances of winning the competition had gone from bad to atrocious.

At least Murdoch was right about one thing - the island was pretty cool. He had no idea where this intervention was going, but it sure was entertaining.
