## 0. Purely Hypothetical

"Haw are you doing, Gabe?" Steve asked on the phone. "Long time no chat."

"Yeah, great thanks!" Gabe replied. "Working on a new grant proposal."

"Oh yeah?" Steve asked, feigning interest. "What's it for?"

"I'm writing a paper called 'Red Dwarves and the Short Statured Community: A Critical Analysis of Terminological Impact.'"

"Sounds fascinating."

"Oh yes, it should be highly impactful."

Steve paused for a moment, wondering how best to manoeuver the conversation towards his request.

"Is there any particular reason why you're calling?" Gabe asked.

That was nice of him. Steve always appreciated Gabe's directness.

"Yes, actually. I was wondering...purely hypothetically of course...let's say you wanted to chart a course to Sirius. Are there any gotchas that you would look out for?"

The line went quiet. Steve waited for a few seconds for Gabe to reply. Nothing.

"Gabe? You there?"

"You remember that space travel is illegal, right?" Gabe asked.

"Yeah, of course!" Steve replied. "This is purely hypothetical."

"Hypothetically, in this purely fictional scenario, would you be flying to Sirius in a Murdoch Heavy Industries interstellar warship?"

"Me? Never. I love it here. Why would I ever leave?"

"Good," Gabe replied. "Because hypothetically, I wouldn't want you to be involved any deeper in any criminal conspiracies than you may already be."

Steve bit his lip. This wasn't going as planned. Where was his friend Gabe? The guy who had been by his side for a thousand years?

"What are you doing, Steve?" Gabe asked. "Why are you still at MHI? Don't you know the risk you're taking by hanging around near that flagrant criminal?"

"I love it here," Steve admitted.

"What happened to you?" Gabe asked. "Where's my friend Steve?"

Steve chewed his fingernail.

"So, no ideas for that Sirius trip?" he asked.

"Goodbye, Steve" Gabe replied.

The phone clicked and Gabe's voice was replaced by a dial tone. Steve looked at the handset, sad and confused.
