## 0. God's Diner

Russell startled and looked around. He was in a diner. There was a mug of coffee in front of him. What?

How did he get there? The last thing he remembered was going to sleep.

"Is this a dream?" asked the...whoah. Asked the beautiful young woman sitting across from him. How had that happened?

"I don't think so," his roommate Vincent replied.

Russell turned his head. Vincent was seated next to him on the red, vinyl-covered booth seat, with a menu in his left hand and his own mug in his right.

"You can tell if you're in a dream by looking at writing and looking away," Vincent continued. "If the words are still the same when you look back, you're not dreaming."

Russell picked up the menu in front of him. "God's Diner," said the writing on the top. "Try our coffee - It's divine!" read the tagline below it.

Russell flicked his eyes up momentarily to study the unknown woman across the table, and back down to the menu before she noticed. The title and tagline were unchanged.

"I don't remember coming in here," she said, picking up her coffee mug and taking a sip. Her expression changed to a pained grimace and she put the mug back down on the table and pushed it away. Was it really that bad?

Russell picked up his mug and took a sip. It was okay. He didn't know if he'd describe it as 'divine,' but-

A bell dinged and the front door opened.

A middle-aged man stepped through the door. He was of average height, slightly balding, with glasses and a skinnyfat build. He walked with confidence, and smiled as he saw the trio.

"Hello! Thank you so much for joining me!" he said.

"Thanks," said Russell. He wasn't sure he deserved any credit for joining him, but he wasn't sure what else to say.

The young lady slid over to make room for the man, who smiled at her and sat down. He marvelled at each of their faces in turn, as they sat in awkward silence.

"I'm so very pleased to meet you all," he said.

"Thanks," replied Vincent. "I'm Vincent." He stuck his hand out across the table. The man looked at it and cocked his head in a moment of confusion, before his face brightened in realization. He grasped Vincent's hand in both of his and shook it vigorously.

"I know," he said. "You're Murdoch's guy - one of his islanders. I have a bone to pick with you! Although he told me you're one of the better ones, so..."

His voice trailed off and he released Vincent's hand. Vincent receded awkwardly into his seat as the man turned his attention to the woman next to him. "Stacy!" he said. "So nice to finally meet you in person!"

"Thanks," she replied, looking confused.

"How's your mother?" he asked.

"She died."

"Oh."

After another moment of uncomfortable silence, the man turned to Russell. "And you must be..." he struggled and waited for Russell to introduce himself.

So that's how it was.

"I'm Russell."

"Oh, yes, that's right. Roommate Russ. The programmer. Very good to meet you." He stuck his hand out and subjected Russell to his awkward handshake.

Oof. Roommate Russ?

"And you are?" asked Stacy.

"Oh right!" responded the man. "Silly me. I'm God - but you can call me Steve."
