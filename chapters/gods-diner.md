## 0. God's Diner

Russell woke up in a 1950s-style diner. There were four mugs of steaming hot coffee and four slices of peach pie on the table. Seated next to him in the booth was his roommate Vincent, who was studying the menu. Across from them was a young lady whom he didn't recognize, but found extremely attractive. He instinctively avoided meeting her eyes and looked aimlessly around the diner.

"Is this a dream?" she asked.

"I don't think so" responded Vincent, continuing to study the menu. "You can tell if you're in a dream by looking at written words and looking away. If they're still the same when you look back, you're not dreaming. This menu," he added, finally looking up and at the other two booth occupants, "has been claiming that you can buy a cheeseburger for twenty-two cents this whole time."

"Oh," responded the young lady. "I thought you were supposed to pinch yourself." She pinched her forearm and grimaced. It left a mark.

"I'm not sure if there's any evidence to support-" started Vincent, before Russell cut him off.

"Twenty-two cents for a cheeseburger? Let me see that menu."

The menu was drawn in a vintage Americana style, which felt out of place in their home town of Perth, Western Australia. The cheeseburger came with fries, and was indeed listed as costing twenty-two cents. Other options were a milkshake (20 cents), a grilled cheese sandwich (25 cents), and a blue plate special (roast beef and two sides, ninety-nine cents). After memorizing a few items, Russell mustered the nerve to glance up at the lady across the table, before flicking his eyes back down to the menu. The items were unchanged.

"I don't remember coming in here," said the woman, picking up her coffee mug and studying the bottom of it for clues. Russell looked around the diner. Apart from them, it was deserted. Just as he rose from the booth to go investigate further, the front door opened and a bell dinged.

A middle-aged man stepped through the door. He was of average height, slightly balding, with glasses and a skinnyfat build. He walked with confidence, and smiled as he saw the trio.

"Hello! Thank you so much for joining me. Please, sit down!" he said, gesturing Russell back into the booth.

"Thanks," responded Russell. He sat down, confused and nervous.

The man slid into the booth next to the young lady. He marvelled at each of their faces in turn, as they sat in awkward silence. "I'm so very pleased to meet you," he said.

"Thanks," responded Vincent. "I'm Vincent." He stuck his hand out across the table. The man looked at it and cocked his head in a moment of confusion, before his face brightened in realization. He grasped Vincent's hand in both of his and shook it vigorously.

"I know," he said. "You're one of Murdoch's islanders. I'm very pleased to meet you." 

The man's face broke out in a huge smile as he moved on to the woman. "Stacy," he said. "So nice to finally meet you in person! Sorry to hear about your mother."

The young lady looked confused, and teared up at the mention of her mom.

Finally, the man turned to Russell. "And you must be..." he struggled and waited for Russell to introduce himself.

"I'm Russell."

"Oh, yes, that's right. Roommate Russ. Very good to meet you." He stuck his hand out and subjected Russell to his awkward handshake.

Russell was slightly offended.

"And you are?" asked Stacy.

"Oh right!" responded the man. "Silly me. I'm God - but you can call me Steve."
