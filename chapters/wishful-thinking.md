## 0. Good Knowing You

"They're parachutes!" Stacy exclaimed. "Look!"

Russell groaned. He didn't feel like looking. Thirty-six hours of insanely high g-forces had left his body feeling like it needed a rebuild. His fluids had settled in all the wrong places and he was pretty sure some of his bearings had deformed. He needed some sort of...monkeybot spa.

"Just shake it off," Stacy said. "You really gotta check this out."

Russell unbuckled his harness, floated out of his chair, and shook his limbs a little. It really did seem to help. He coasted to the window and looked outside.

They had been right. There wasn't a Dyson sphere. There wasn't a vacuum cleaner, or a papier-mâché structure. Instead, there were billions, possibly trillions, of...parachutes. Enormous, octagonal kites, tethered to small, barely-visible payloads, all floating in space and pointed in the direction of Sirius's dim glow.

"Whoa," he gasped. "That's..."

"A lot of parachutes?" Stacy suggested.

"Beautiful," he finished.

Stacy shrugged. "Do you see that one?" she asked, pointing in the distance. "It's coming towards us."

Russell zoomed his vision in the direction she was pointing. Sure enough, one of the parachutes had tilted its canopy in their direction, and was rapidly moving towards them as if propelled by an invisible wind.

"We don't have any weapons, do we?" he asked.

Stacy shook her head. "We weren't supposed to make contact," she replied.

He bit his lip. It was tougher than his original human lip, like Steve had used some cheap material originally destined to become rubber bands. If they weren't supposed to make contact, why did the flight plan have them decelerating so much? Seemed like making contact was part of the plan.

"Let's hope they're friendly," he said.

"They're never friendly," Stacy responded.

With no sense of scale, Russell found it impossible to estimate the size or distance of the kite. It just kept approaching and growing, until it blocked out an enormous swath of space, and still it grew.

"How big do you think it is?" he asked.

"No idea," Stacy responded in awe. "Must be hundreds of kilometers across. Like a...Tasmania."

The payload was clearer now. It was a doughnut, and appeared to be spinning.

"What's that?" Stacy asked.

Russell scratched his head. "You see a spinning thing in space, you think artificial gravity. Long-term habitation."

She looked at him, wordlessly.

"Chances are, there's life on that doughnut."

"I don't like it," Stacy stated. "Punch the throttle and let's get out of here."

Russell's mind filled with images of him on an operating table, screaming in agony while being vivisected by curious tentacled aliens. He looked up. The stars were gone - all obscured by the enormous black canopy of the octagonal parachute. Every other direction was similarly filled with parachutes.

There was no way out.

"I bet we can punch through the chute," Stacy said.

"Would you bet your life? If it's strong enough to damage the ship..."

As he tried not to picture the operating table, a blast appeared on the stationary platform connecting the doughnut to the parachute.

"What was that?" Stacy asked.

Russell didn't reply. A few moments later, the answer became clear. The ship was rocked with a dull _thud_. They looked out the window.

A tether now ran from them to the doughnut.

"Goddamn it," Russell muttered.

"Good knowing you," Stacy replied.

---

"Are they going to vivisect us?" Stacy asked Russell as their ship was winched in towards the doughnut.

Russell laughed. Great minds.

"No way," he replied. "Why would they do that?"

Stacy looked at him blankly, as if the answer was self-evident. "They're aliens," she stated flatly.

"We're much more interesting if they keep us alive," Russell lied.

The doughnut continued to approach and take up more of their field of view. Before long, it was all either of them could see.

"How big do you think it is?" Stacy asked.

Russell shook his head as he watched the doughnut grow. "It's gotta be the size of a city," he mused. "Canberra?"

Stacy nodded. "There's still time to fire up the rocket," she suggested. "I bet our ship is stronger than the tether."

Russell pondered the dilemma. The ship was pretty strong. It would probably hold together. But did he actually want to flee? Didn't he want to see what was inside the Canberra-sized space doughnut attached to the Tasmania-sized parachute?

An enormous port opened on the top of the doughnut, revealing a dark cavern into which the tether disappeared.

"Guess I don't have much of a choice," Stacy conceded.

The ship was reeled into the recess, and the universe disappeared. A few moments later, the craft stopped with a sudden _thud_. As the artificial gravity kicked in, the two monkeybots were thrown to the floor.

"No sign of life on the scans," announced an unfamiliar voice. "Maybe it's a probe?"

"Maybe it's a bomb," suggested another voice. "You can't be too careful with those Rotarian bastards."

Russell and Stacy huddled together in the corner of the bridge, trying to make themselves as small as possible. Russell prayed that the intruders would leave, before remembering that prayer no longer did anything. His God was six weeks away and powerless to intervene - up here in the afterlife, Steve was just a regular guy.

"A lot of empty space for a bomb," continued the first voice. "And a pair of beds. Why does a bomb need beds?"

As he listened to the alien intruders stomp around the living quarters, Russell was struck by the realization that he understood them. He looked at Stacy, who had clearly had the same thought.

He stood up and offered a hand to help her up.

"We can talk our way out of this," he explained. "They're not going to vivisect people they can understand."

"Wishful thinking," Stacy responded, taking his hand and pulling herself up. "Aliens do messed up stuff all the time."

"They can't actually be-" Russell started.

The door opened and in walked the aliens.

Russell's jaw dropped. His mind raced to make sense of what he was seeing - The aliens looked exactly like Steve's people. Shorter and stockier than Steve and Gabe, but definitely the same species. They reminded him of Murdoch. Now that he thought about it, they sounded like him too. What was going on?

"Holy God above!" exclaimed the owner of the first voice, reeling backwards. "What the hell are those?"

His partner drew some sort of firearm and raised it at the two monkeybots. "Shall I shoot them?" he asked.

"I'd rather you didn't," said Russell.

Both aliens jumped at the sound of his voice and the second one dropped his gun.

"Feck!" he exclaimed.
