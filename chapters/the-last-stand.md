## 0. The Last Stand

Russell and Stacy blasted until they were out of ammo. The palace grounds were littered with the tangled corpses of black-clad paramilitaries, variously missing limbs and riddled with massive holes. In the end, though, there were just too many of them.

Russell clicked his trigger uselessly as the masked combatants marched up the stairs towards them. "Damn. Did you save any rounds for us?" he asked.

"Nope," Stacy responded. "Empty."

Russell looked over the parapet at the moat below. Not nearly high enough to guarantee death on impact. "Got a knife?" he asked.

"Nope."

"I guess this is it, then."

"Looks like it."

"Sorry for dragging you into this."

"No worries, mate. That's what friends are for."

Russell looked at his old friend and forced a weak smile. She reciprocated. He remembered when they'd first met, all those years ago in the diner. How he'd been too nervous to meet her eyes. He recalled how he'd looked down on her for being a social media influencer, and how wrong he'd been. Then, the years of friendship, the bitter disputes, the fierce loyalty up to the very end. His heart broke for her. He truly was sorry.

A rough voice interrupted his thoughts. "Down on your knees, hands on your head!" The paramilitaries had arrived.

Russell and Stacy sank to their knees and complied. The masked men zip-tied their hands behind their backs, and threw hoods over their heads.

The world went black.
