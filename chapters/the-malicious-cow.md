## 0. The Malicious Cow

Steve was glad that his monkeybots were coming to terms with the prospect of never seeing their children again, because judging by how Stacy II's progress was going, family reunification was not in the cards. She'd taken some sort of low-level government job in the Commonwealth and seemed to spend most of her time manipulating some software called "PowerPoint".

---

Stacy II crouched behind her computer monitor, trying to avoid the malicious cow's attention. No luck. She tromped through the office and stopped by Stacy II's desk.

"Hi darling," her supervisor said. "Do you have that presentation ready yet?"

Stacy II quietly dug a ball-point pen into her thigh to distract her from the unfamiliar torment of maintaining a professional facade in a white-collar environment. "Not yet," she replied. "You only just told me about it last night."

"Okay, well, we're kind of on a deadline, you know?"

Stacy II smiled politely as she pictured Filbert's domestic terror squad hog-tying the malevolent bureaucrat and drowning her in the Pacific.

"I'll have it ready within the hour," she replied.

"Thanks, darling! Oh, and another thing. I realized that focusing on Eastern European gyms might be construed as a bit...well...I worry we might be sending the wrong message! Do you mind switching it to Polynesians? Thank you!"

With that, she strode off, leaving Stacy II staring at her nearly complete presentation on Sanitation Practices in the Eastern European Immigrant Gymnasium Community. She had worked on it all night. Stifling a sob, she deleted every slide after the title slide, changed "Eastern European" to "Polynesian", and started again.

That night, Stacy II stopped by the warehouse in an abandoned region of the PR where Filbert was housing his domestic terror squad. Inside, Filbert appeared to be experiencing some regret at having enlisted Blake and Archibald into the team.

"I'm not eating that!" Archibald objected, batting away the candy bar. "It looks like a dump!"

"You'll like it," Blake insisted. "Trust me."

"Like a solid, straight dump!"

Stacy II laughed. As she surveyed the rest of his rag-tag band of would-be miscreants, she was reminded that Archibald and Blake were the only two with actual, up-close, violent experience. With any luck, they'd soon move past their culture shock and instruct the others in their martial methods.

"Status report?" she asked.

Blake attempted to respond, but his mouth being full of chocolate, marshmallow and caramelized high-fructose corn syrup made his words unintelligible.

Archibald glared at him. "What my dump-eating superior is trying to explain," he interjected, "is that we've found the cow's apartment. We knocked on the door after she left and there were like ten other people crammed inside. Mattresses all over the floor. You losers live in worse conditions than we do."

"What did you say when they opened the door?" Filbert asked.

"Pretended to be ceiling inspectors," Archibald responded. "That's a thing here, right?"

Stacy II raised an eyebrow and looked at the rest of the team, who were similarly bemused. "I can't say that-"

"Anyway, their ceilings were crap," Archibald interrupted. "Made out of these foamy squares. They move when you touch 'em. I told 'em I'd give 'em a report and they'd have two weeks to sort 'em out."

"Okay, sure, whatever. So you can't nab her at her apartment?"

Blake finally swallowed his mouthful of confectionary and responded. "Nah, way too crowded. We'll have to get her on her way home."

"I thought you said yesterday that her commute's too crowded too?"

Blake nodded. "Yeah, it is."

Stacy II sighed. "Anyone else got any ideas?" he asked the group.

The pretty Anarchist girl, Annabel, piped up. "Yeah, I had one."

---

Half an hour later, the team had transformed the warehouse into a makeshift photography studio. Stacy II tapped her arm impatiently as Annabel flitted around with a DSLR camera.

Stacy II didn't like Annabel very much. Not that she'd ever done anything to offend her. Objectively, she was quite sweet. Mostly, Stacy II didn't like her because of the way Filbert looked at her.

Not that she liked Filbert very much either. He was servant material - and lousy servant material, at that. Sure, it had been nice of him to rescue her from New Australia and to put together this terrorism group. But was he doing it out of loyalty to the crown, or just to impress that harlot?

"Beautiful!" Annabel exclaimed, adjusting her camera and snapping another picture of Blake. "Try to subtly clench your teeth as you smile, really make that jawline pop. There you go! What a hunk!"

Stacy II glared at Filbert as he glared at Annabel.

"Thanks, Annabel," Blake responded, relaxing his jaw and running his hands through his recently styled hair. "Are we done yet?"

"No!" Annabel replied. "Now we need to do the group shots! If your dating profile doesn't have at least one group shot, she'll think you're a psycho who wants to kidnap and murder her."

"Right," Filbert said, tapping his arm impatiently. "Can't have that."

"It's already going to be an uphill battle," Annabel smirked. "Let's not make it any harder than it already is. Now get in the frame and try to make Blake look charming."

Filbert got in the frame and tried to make Blake look charming.

Stacy II shook her head and retreated to the warehouse kitchen. She had a presentation to work on.

---

Steve watched the screen with interest. Stacy II's boss - the one they referred to as the "cow" - was on a "date" with Blake. This, he gathered, was one of those mating rituals upon which his AIs spent an inordinate amount of time.

He hoped they didn't mate. The offspring would likely not maximize the potential of Blake's genes.

"What a charming accent!" the malicious cow remarked over her extra large glass of house red. "Where did you say you were from?"

"Err," Blake responded, utterly unprepared. "Well, my parents are from Cocklebiddy."

"Cocklebiddy! What a lovely name. Is it nice?"

"Oh yes," Blake lied. "Very posh. They used to play golf."

"I'd love to visit some time! Will you take me?"

"How about I take you back to my apartment first?"

Filbert and Annabel, seated just within earshot, simultaneously winced. Steve adjusted their volume slider to try to get a running commentary. These mating rituals were a total mystery to him - hopefully his AIs' conversation would provide some insight as to how this was supposed to win them back control of The Commonwealth and force millions of AIs back into alignment.

"This was a terrible idea," Filbert whispered.

"I think it's going okay!" Annabel whispered back.

"I'm going to die from second-hand embarrassment."

"He's hotter than ninety-nine percent of these soy-fed twinks," she hissed, gesturing around the restaurant. "He could say anything and she'll still leave with him. Mark my words."

So far, completely unenlightening. Perhaps Filbert and Annabel were performing a mating ritual of their own? Steve began to lose interest.

"It's not going to work," Filbert grumbled.

"Look!" Annabel whispered excitedly. "There they go now!"

Filbert slammed his drink, grabbed Annabel's arm, and together they followed Blake and the cow out of the restaurant.

Steve scratched his chin as he watched them jog down the road. Bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. Apes, man.

The cow was in love. She reflected on all those lonely nights she'd spent, drinking tequila and swiping through profiles. The awful dates, with low-quality men who looked nothing like their pictures. The bad decisions - the more of which she'd made, the more tequila she'd needed to drink to forget.

Finally, her prayers had been answered. A genuine stud of a man - sculpted from marble by Michelangelo and brought to life by divine magic - had not only shown interest in her, but invited her back to his apartment. His _own_ apartment, where he lived _by himself_. She was so head over heels, that she barely noticed when an unmarked van pulled up next to them and the door slid open.

She heard running behind her. She turned and saw a young couple who had been at the bar, running up to her. She looked quizzically at the hunk, who inexplicably seized her, and with the couple's help, shoved her into the van. The three climbed in after her, the door slid shut, and the van was moving again before she had time to scream.

Twenty minutes later, the van was parked and she was unloaded. The stench of stale excrement filled her nostrils. They were in the lowlands. She retched as the three reprobates prodded her into a warehouse and filed in behind her.

Her latest hire was standing in the warehouse, smiling.

"Fancy seeing you here!" Stacy II exclaimed.

"You _bitch_!" she exploded. "You absolute _bitch_!"

"You don't like your new digs?"

"I hope you burn in hell!"

"We ran out of air freshener."

"Your presentation sucked too!"

"I was pressed for time."

"People were practically falling asleep!"

Stacy II declined to answer. She folded her arms, tapped her hand and smiled at her patiently.

"Why the hell did you have to play with my heart?" the cow asked, tears welling in her eyes. "And why have you dragged me to the septics?"

Stacy II laughed. "You want to get out of here?" she asked.

"Yes!"

"Okay," Stacy II said. "Follow me."

The cow followed Stacy II into the kitchen. A laptop was open on the table, displaying a document. She read it. It was a letter of resignation, nominating Stacy II as her replacement. It included such phrases as "absolutely stand-out performer," "vastly overqualified," and "destined for greatness."

"A bit on the nose, don't you think?" she asked.

"Digitally sign it and send it to everyone above you. Then you can go," Stacy II replied.

The cow sized up her adversary. She was petite. Although the cow wasn't much of a fighter, she could probably subdue the tiny woman with ease. Crush her. Smother her.

Seeming to read her mind, Stacy II cleared her throat and nodded behind her. The cow looked over her shoulder and saw that the hunk and the couple had been joined by an assortment of underworld characters, brandishing crowbars, kitchen knives, and menacing-looking power tools whose names she didn't know. The implication was clear. She pressed her index finger into the laptop's fingerprint scanner, held her eye up to the camera, and digitally signed the document.

Stacy II stepped forward and closed the laptop. "Now that wasn't so hard, was it?" she asked, as the miscreants closed in and seized the cow's arms.

"What's all this?" she asked. "You said I could go!"

"Of course you can go!" Stacy II replied sweetly. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a gold coin. "I just didn't specify where."

The cow sputtered and began to regret how she'd treated her underling. "Look, I'm sorry I insulted your presentation! It wasn't that bad, honestly!"

"Death or transportation?" Stacy II asked, grinning. She flipped the coin, caught it, and slapped it on her wrist. Peeking under her hand, she grimaced.

"And I'm sorry about the Polynesian thing! I shouldn't have switched the subject last-minute, I know!"

Stacy II chuckled. She was clearly enjoying this. The cow hated her with all her heart.

"Unlucky," her adversary announced. "You got transportation."

The cow relaxed a little bit. Transportation didn't sound too bad.

Stacy II moved closer and whispered menacingly into her ear. "You'll wish you'd gotten death."

The stench of the stale human feces was replaced by the smell of her own breath, filling the black fabric hood that was secured over her head. She lost track of time during the long, cold boat ride. The hood was finally removed after what felt like days. Blinking in the light, she stumbled as she was pushed into a small room. No, not a room - a hyperloop shuttle.

The doors closed and away she went. They opened again hours later, and she stepped out into the midday sun. The air smelled of rotting meat, and she was immediately assaulted by flies. She seemed to be in some sort of village.

"Hello hello hello!" rang out a deep voice. "What have we here? Untended human capital, just hanging out by the hyperloop station?"

---

Steve closed the view of New Australia and rubbed his eyes. That had been quite the show. What had he learned?

AI mating rituals were high-stakes operations. Best to steer clear.

And Stacy II was absolutely insane.
