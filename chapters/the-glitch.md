## 0. The Glitch

Conquering the pacifists turned out to be as easy as expected. Getting them to perform any useful function, on the other hand, was a different story.

"If you're not going to join the infantry, can you at least help with weapons manufacturing?" Stacy II asked. "I see some excellent handiwork here. We could use people with your talents." She gestured at the yurts, which were noticeably cleaner and more ornate than the ones at Archibald's village.

"And join your military-industrial complex? Fat chance! Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind! It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man!", responded the weedy, dreadlocked, mid-fifties representative of the pacifists.

"Right. Well, despite wielding the 'mightiest weapons of destruction,' you've just been conquered. Perhaps you can maintain your non-violence while conforming with that reality?"

"What do you suggest?"

"Si vis pacem, para bellum."

The man nodded. "In retrospect, we probably should have done that a while ago."

Despite their leader's admission of the pragmatic superiority of "if you want peace, prepare for war", the pacifists nonetheless slow-walked the design and manufacturing of Stacy II's bows and arrows. Perhaps they suspected that Stacy II didn't really "vis pacem". While she and Archibald's clan marched around the region conquering other easy targets, Filbert was assigned to keeping the pacifists on task. He soon found himself doing a large bulk of the work himself, wishing for a whip. 

He based his bow design on what he could recollect from a magazine article on the Mongols that he had read several years ago. Their bows were a composite design, built from layers of wood, horn and sinew. He was able to outsource the collection of horn and sinew and the shaping of the wood, but final assembly, being too closely tied to 'weapons of destruction', fell to him.

Eventually, after witnessing his fourth bow attempt shatter in his hands, a member of the pacifists approached him in pity. "It's never going to work," he said. "You need glue."

"Gee, thanks!" fumed an exasperated Filbert. "Hey, do you mind walking down to the hardware store and buying me some?"

The pacifist smiled. "I don't know about a hardware store," he chuckled, "but Greg probably has some."

******

Greg, as it turned out, had not only been manufacturing glue from animal hides for years, but was already aware of and entertained by Filbert's struggles.

"So the Secretary of Defense wants some glue, eh? What's he going to pay for it?"

Filbert wanted to reply, "I'll pay 'not blowing your face off with my railgun and feeding you to Cosmo,'" but was committed to operating with a gentler touch than Stacy II.

"Listen, friend," he started.

Greg immediately bristled and his expression became stern. Not a good start, Filbert thought.

"I understand you had a good thing going here. Hanging out, boiling animal hides, living the dream. And then we showed up and drafted your entire village into a war effort."

Greg nodded.

"The thing is, the wheels have been set in motion. A war is on. Sooner or later, someone's going to come for your glue - if not us, the House of Lords, or the Anarcho-Cannibalists."

"The other two never came for my glue before," objected Greg.

"The House of Lords never taxed your glue?"

"Never."

"Oh."

"They did tax my daughter though," Greg added, unhappily.

Filbert was flabbergasted. "They what? Then why don't you want to destroy them? Why are you hanging out here in a pacifist commune, making glue? If it was my daughter, I'd storm the gates myself!"

Tears welled up in Greg's eyes, and he clenched his fists. "Would you, big man? Without your gun? You'd march right up to the city with a stick, and whack the entire House of Lords into submission, would you? You wouldn't last a minute before being captured and locked in the gibbets, you complete and utter ass."

Filbert had to ask for clarification on what the 'gibbets' were. Upon learning the answer, his face lost colour and he fell silent.

Greg picked an earthenware pot off the floor and put it on the low table in front of Filbert.

"Take it and get the hell out of my house," he grumbled.

The glue made the process much easier. Finally, Filbert was able to construct a bow that held together. His next problem was arrows: Without arrowheads, his crudely sharpened sticks span chaotically through the air. They typically struck their target side-on, if they were lucky enough to make contact at all.

Options for making arrowheads were limited. With no minable metal, his choices were clay, bone, or horn. He wasn't a materials scientist, but he could see that the knife he'd appropriated from the pacifists was bone. It was therefore probably the best material for arrowheads, too.

A chicken/egg problem arose. How was he to fashion bone arrowheads, using a bone knife? Every attempt he made at carving bone just ended up blunting or chipping the knife. 

Filbert stopped and pondered the question for a while. How had the pacifists made the bone knife in the first place? He politely asked one. The recalcitrant man sneered and walked away from him, wordlessly.

Filbert began to wonder if he'd prefer living among the Anarcho-Cannibalists. He decided to try subterfuge instead. The next morning, after assigning his reluctant minimum-effort workers to their tasks for the day, he kept the one who seemed to produce the best carvings behind. "Do you mind sharpening this knife for me?" he asked, handing over his blunted and chipped instrument.

The whittler inspected the damaged blade. "It's beyond repair," he replied. "You'll need a new one. I'll fetch you one from the store."

Filbert panicked. That wasn't the plan. "Could you make me a custom one, please? I want the blade to be, uh, really, really curved."

The man rolled his eyes and wandered off down a path. Filbert waited for him to gain some distance, and set off following him.

Eventually, the whittler came to the edge of the trees and glanced perfunctorily around him to make sure he wasn't being followed. After failing to spot a poorly concealed Filbert, he continued into the clearing. Filbert crept up to the boundary and peeked out from behind a tree.

A huge, perfectly flat, white triangle was sticking out of the ground at a bizarre angle. It was so thin that it looked 2D, like some rendering artifact in a video game. A glitch. Filbert assumed that that was exactly what it was - there was no way Vincent would have put it there on purpose. It terminated at a sharp point two stories in the air, to which a rudimentary scaffold had been built for access. Bone shavings littered the ground.

The man picked up a curved jawbone from a pile, and walked to the glitch. He crouched beneath the slanted triangle, and bracing his shoulder against the smooth white surface for stability, dragged the bone against the glitch's edge.

The glitch cut through the bone like a hot knife through butter. The curved knife was carved in under a minute. After it had taken shape, the whittler climbed up the scaffold and used the tip of the glitch to carve something into the handle. Finally, he tucked the blade into his belt, climbed down, and strode back along the path, humming.

Filbert could just make out the carving on the handle as he walked past. It was crude and phallic.

Once he was alone, Filbert emerged from the trees to investigate the glitch. There really wasn't anything else to it. Just a huge, impossibly thin, white triangle jutting out from the ground. He picked up a bone and ran it along the edge. The bone was immediately cut in half. Scary.

Filbert picked up another bone, and set about developing a technique for carving arrowheads. He was terrified at first, but soon settled into a routine and almost began to forget that a single slip could result in the amputation of a limb.

He was interrupted by a voice in his head. "Turn around," it said.

Filbert ignored it. He was busy.

"Filbert, stop what you're doing and turn around," the voice repeated.

Filbert stopped what he was doing and turned around. The whittler had returned, with the weedy pacifist leader and another friend. Unexpectedly caught sneaking up the path, they froze for a moment before standing upright.

"Well well well," announced the leader. "Seems the Minister of War wasn't content with bossing us around. Seems he had to start poking around where he wasn't invited."

Filbert looked for his railgun. He'd put it down, as he didn't want it to get damaged on the glitch. In a near repeat of Stacy II's first human interaction in New Australia, he ran for the railgun, while the whittler ran for him. 

The whittler reached him first, and crashed his shoulder into Filbert's ribs. Filbert collapsed to the floor, and his assailant jumped on him, placing his knees on either side of his abdomen. The whittler straightened up to draw the bone knife he'd carved earlier, and Filbert took advantage of his momentary distraction to heave with all the explosive might he could muster.

He shoved the whittler into the glitch. His attacker was precisely bisected from his nose to his tailbone, producing a detailed exhibit on human anatomy. What seemed like the entire volume of his circulatory system was dumped out at once, and when the blood cleared, Filbert could plainly see the bronchioles of the whittler's lungs, branching out into thousands of spongy grape-like clusters, the cross-sections of his ribs, vertebrae and lower skull, the contents of his intestines, and the structure of many other organs that he couldn't name.

The top half of the whittler's body and all of its associated blood slid down the glitch and crumpled into a mess at the bottom, where the still perfectly white triangle intersected with the ground.

"Pay attention, Filbert!" returned the voice in his head. Filbert wrested his eyes from the fascinating gory mess, and looked around.

The dreadlocked pacifist leader had picked up Filbert's railgun and was aiming it at him.

"Frig," Filbert muttered. "I thought you were pacifists!" he yelled, annoyed.

The leader shrugged. "Si vis pacem, para bellum," he replied.
