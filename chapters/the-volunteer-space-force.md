## 0. The Volunteer Space Force

Russell stared in awe at the megastructures being assembled in the Murdoch Heavy Industries parking lot. A hundred fusion rockets - each equipped with its own nanoscale manufacturing plant - stood awaiting the respective vacuum ballons that would carry them into the stratosphere.

Allegedly, the rocket payloads combined to form an interstellar radio. In reality, they did no such thing. This was the flat-packed version of Xavier's orbital ring. Stacy had casually mentioned to him that space launches were banned, which would render the orbital ring the largest piece of criminal infrastructure...ever, probably.

What was really going on here? Why was he working for a bunch of criminals? And did he have any choice in the matter?

That afternoon, Murdoch called a meeting. Russell entered to the conference room. Steve, Stacy, and Vincent were already there. Murdoch walked in a couple of minutes late, stinking of cigarettes.

"Thank you all for coming," he greeted them. "How's everything going?"

After some pleasantries and logistical discussions surrounding fab space, Murdoch turned the conversation to the meeting's actual agenda.

"The tech transfer seems to be going well," he said. "Assuming we get those balloons built, we'll be in orbit in a matter of days."

The team nodded.

"We could have an interstellar spacecraft in as little as a month."

Russell double-checked his timeline in his head. It was aggressive, but not impossible. Innovations were popping out of the sim at a blistering pace, and from what he'd read in the textbooks, interstellar travel wasn't nearly as much of a challenge in Realistic Physics as it was down in StevieNix.

"So my question to you lot is, what will our first interstellar mission look like? Who will go, where will they go, and what equipment will they need?"

Russell watched, mostly quietly, as the others argued for the next twenty minutes - occasionally being subtly guided in particular directions by Murdoch's leading, Socratic-style questions.

He was obviously manipulating them. Slowly, a picture of his wishes emerged.

The first mission would be a scouting trip to Sirius. The craft would be the smallest possible vehicle that could get them there and back - a tin can with a fusion rocket. As for who would go, the ideal crew would have little-to-no life support requirements, the ability to withstand extremely high g-forces, and not be too missed back home.

Murdoch's questions to the monkeybots got more pointed. 

Russell looked at his shoes. How missed would he be back home?

Last he checked, Filbert was doing okay. He seemed to have formed a nice group of friends and they spent a lot of time in some warehouse somewhere. His wife and his other kids had already processed his death - as far as they were concerned, it had been just like any other death.

The bigger question was, did he want to become a criminal? Blatantly violate the most important law on Elba for no personal gain, other than to please the guy who financed his creation?

He didn't have to go to space. He could also just dob Steve and Murdoch in to FEDSEC, and live out the rest of his life with his feet on the ground, doing...what, exactly?

What would be the point of anything if Steve and Murdoch were gone?

Steve had long-ago insisted that he had free will. But when push came to shove, how much could he really control? He was a robot. A manufactured product. Property of Murdoch Heavy Industries. Property doesn't get a real say in its fate, it can choose to either serve its owner or be discarded.

At least, he thought, he could choose the fate that gave him a little bit of dignity.

"I'll go," he volunteered.

Murdoch nodded. "Good man," he replied. "You'll need a crewmate though."

Russell, and everyone else, looked over at Stacy. She flushed and looked down. Russell could tell she was going through the same thought process as him.

"I'll go," she said. Turning to Steve, she added, "just take care of Stacy II for me."

Murdoch clapped his hands. "Excellent!" he said. "It'll be loads of fun, I'm sure. If not, perhaps there's some way to hibernate you. Hah! Thank you all for coming, meeting adjourned!"

The rest of the team filed out of the conference room, leaving Stacy and Russell to sit in silence, bewildered.

"Excited?" asked Russell, breaking the silence.

Stacy forced a smile. "Of course," she said. "I just hope they serve good food on board."

Russell laughed. "The finest rehydrated nutrient packs money can buy."

The freezing cold ocean spray flew over the side of their small boat and drenched Russell through his clothes and to his robotic skin. Praying that his monkeybot was waterproof, he retreated back into the cabin and shut the door.

"Last time I was on a boat with you, we almost died," he remarked to Stacy.

"And look at us now," she smiled back. Then, her face dropped a little as she remembered the stakes. "Of course," she added, "if we die this time, it's actually for real."

Russell tried not to think about her comment. Stumbling forward, he grabbed a handrail for balance as the boat crested a wave and came crashing down into the trough.

Stacy groaned and lay down on the floor. "Remind me why we can't just launch from land again?" she asked.

"Discretion," he replied. "FEDSEC."

"Right," she said. "Well, you'd think they could have given us a bigger boat."

"Too visible," he shrugged. "Just be grateful we have a cabin this time."

The boat crested another wave and came crashing down again. Russell groaned and lay down next to her. He really hoped his monkeybot couldn't vomit.

---

He was woken by Vincent's voice crackling over the radio. "Approaching the launchpad!" Vincent announced.

He clambered to hes feet and made his way to join Stacy at the front of the cabin. "See anything?" he asked, staring out into the blackness beyond.

"Nothing," she responded.

Russell pressed his face to the glass, trying to make out any shapes in the dark, moonless night. He might as well have been blindfolded.

Without warning, the boat thudded and came to a sudden stop. His face smacked against the window. It hurt, just like a real face would have.

"You have arrived at your destination," Vincent announced.

"Couldn't have brought it in more smoothly?" Russell asked, rubbing his nose.

"Be thankful you got there," Vincent replied. "I'd like to see you navigate here without GPS."

Russell withdrew from the argument. Navigating to a raft in the middle of the ocean was one thing. Navigating to a vanished star in the outer reaches of the galaxy was a whole other challenge. Best to stay focused.

He opened the cabin door and stepped out with Stacy onto the deck. As his eyes adjusted to the low light, he made out their home for the next three months - a house-sized black cylinder lying on its side, above which loomed an enormous balloon.

He was already familiar with it from the CAD drawings. For Stacy's benefit, he pointed at one end of the cylinder. "Fusion rockets," he explained. Then, panning over to the other end of the cylinder, he said "living quarters."

Picking up his bag, he walked towards the living quarters. Stacy nodded and followed.

"What do you mean, I have to accelerate it? I need to slow the shuttle down to drop the tether," crackled Vincent's annoyed voice on the radio.

"It's relative, remember?" replied an exasperated Xavier. "To slow down relative to you, the shuttle needs to speed up relative to the ring."

"This is terrible UX," Vincent grumbled.

"You do realize that the orbital ring is spinning, right? It's in the name. It orbits."

"Who designed this interface? Don't tell me you did it."

"Come on, dad. It's not that bad."

"A chicken could have done a better job."

"Dad-"

"I'm serious. Next time you need to make a user interface, just grab a chicken and scatter some grain on a keyboard. It'll produce a more usable design."

The father/son duo had been bickering on the shared line for ten minutes. Russell drummed his fingers nervously and glanced at Stacy, who responded with a look that said "man, I really hope these idiots figure this out." Russell reflected for a moment on the expressive realism of her monkeybot's prosthetic face, before turning his attention to the window. He could just make out the ocean, kilometers below the high altitude to which they'd risen with the balloon.

The faintest rays of sunshine were just starting to light up the sky. If Vincent and Xavier didn't get the launch mechanism figured out in the next few minutes, they'd lose the cover of darkness - and with it, any remaining pretense that the orbital ring was an interstellar radio. FEDSEC would begin raids almost immediately. He could imagine them confiscating all electronic devices, which would imply the powering down of StevieNix and the death of everyone he loved. If Steve had thought to install sweat glands, his palms would be drenched right now.

His wandering mind was snapped into the present by Vincent's excited voice. "Finally! Prepare for launch!" he announced.

He sighed in relief and looked again at Stacy, who was tightening the straps on her five-point harness. He did the same while craning his neck upwards, trying to spot the descending tether in the dim morning light. All he could see was the enormous black balloon above them.

The spaceship clunked. "Tether attached," Vincent announced. "Now, let me guess - to take off, I have to decelerate the shuttle?"

"Correct," Xavier responded. "Because the ring is spinning."

Russell could sense Vincent's paternalistic, teasing smile over the crackle of the radio. "Seriously, get a chicken" he replied. "It'll help. Anyway, hold on tight!"

The balloon released the ship, and Russell let out an involuntary gasp as the support of his chair disappeared and the entire cabin entered a sickening freefall. A moment later, he was slammed back into her chair in a violent jerk as the tether taughtened. Kilometers above them, attached to the orbital ring, the shuttle started accelerating - or decelerating, or whatever.

"Oof," groaned Stacy. "This sucks."

Russell struggled to reply. Once again praying that his monkeybot didn't have the ability to puke, he closed his eyes and gripped his armrests. Bracing against the enormous g-forces, he and Stacy hung on for dear life as the craft was yanked up through the atmosphere and flung out into space.
