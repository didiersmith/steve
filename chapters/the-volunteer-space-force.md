## 0. The Volunteer Space Force

Every time Stacy walked into the office, there was someone new there. Now that the three monkeybots had managed to produce exciting technology without killing anybody, everyone suddenly wanted to join the team.

As the Project Manager, Stacy suddenly found herself inundated with work.

"Hi Stacy," said one of the recent additions to the team. "Do you mind if I get a few minutes on the fab today? There's a new carbon-titanium lattice I want to try out."

Stacy checked her spreadsheet. "Sorry," she apologized, "the earliest slot I have is six minutes on Monday at 3:18AM."

The person grumbled but accepted the slot and wandered off back to his computer to watch the developments in the Cube of Realistic Physics.

"Getting pretty tight, aren't we?" Russell asked.

"He's lucky he only wants a few minutes," Stacy responded. "The next full hour is almost three weeks out."

Russell sucked air in through his synthetic robot teeth and shook his head. "We need more fab space," he remarked.

"I've already asked Murdoch," she replied.

That afternoon, a meeting was called. The three AIs entered into the conference room together and greeted Steve, who was already there. Murdoch arrived a few minutes late, and shut the door.

"Thank you all for coming," he greeted them. "How's everything going?"

After some pleasantries and logistical discussions surrounding fab space, Murdoch turned the conversation to the meeting's actual agenda.

"The tech transfer seems to be going well," he said. "Assuming we get our fab issues sorted, we'll be in orbit in a matter of weeks."

The team nodded.

"We could have an interstellar spacecraft in as little as a month."

Stacy glanced at her spreadsheet. The timing seemed aggressive, but not impossible. Innovations were popping out of the sim at a blistering pace, and from what she'd gleaned from the boys, interstellar travel wasn't nearly as much of a challenge in Realistic Physics as it was thought to be down in StevieNix.

"So my question to you lot is, what will our first interstellar mission look like? Who will go, where will they go, and what equipment will they need?"

Stacy watched as the boys argued for the next twenty minutes, occasionally being subtly guided in particular directions by Murdoch's leading, Socratic-style questions. Slowly, a picture emerged.

The first mission would be a scouting trip to Sirius. The craft would be the smallest possible vehicle that could get them there and back - a tin can with a fusion rocket. As for who would go, the ideal crew would have little-to-no life support requirements, the ability to withstand extremely high g-forces, and not be too missed back home.

Murdoch's questions to the monkeybots got more pointed.

Eventually, Russell caved to the manipulative businessman's pressure. "I'll go," he volunteered.

Murdoch nodded. "Good man," he replied. "You'll need a crewmate though."

Stacy flushed as she felt everyone's eyes flick in her direction. She didn't want to go to the disappeared star. She wanted to stay where she was. She was perfectly happy playing Project Manager, enjoying her coffees with Steve, and keeping an eye on her husband and children in StevieNix. They needed her! The number of times she'd helped her daughter out of a jam...

The room was silent. The decision had already been made. Everyone knew who Russell's crewmate would be, the only remaining matter was for her to accept it.

Stacy looked down. The other day, while she was changing, she'd noticed an inscription on the bottom of her synthetic foot - _Property of Murdoch Heavy Industries_. Property. Property doesn't get to choose its fate, but it can choose the amount of dignity it has on the way.

"I'll come with you," she volunteered.

"Excellent!" Murdoch replied. "It'll be loads of fun, I'm sure. If not, perhaps there's some way to hibernate you. Hah! Thank you all for coming, meeting adjourned!"

The rest of the team filed out of the conference room, leaving Stacy and Russell to sit in silence, bewildered.

"Excited?" asked Russell, breaking the silence.

Stacy forced a smile. "Of course," she lied. "I just hope they serve good food on board."

Russell laughed. "The finest rehydrated nutrient packs money can buy," he said.

With that, he got up and left the room, leaving Stacy alone to ponder the prospect of being shot off into outer space with some nutrient packs and a very low likelihood of return.

She really, really preferred the spreadsheets.

The freezing cold ocean spray flew over the side of their small boat and drenched Stacy through her clothes and to her robotic skin. Praying that her monkeybot was waterproof, she retreated back into the cabin and shut the door.

"Last time I was on a boat with you, we almost died," she remarked to Russell.

"And look at us now," he smiled back. Then, his face dropped a little as he remembered the stakes. "Of course," he added, "if we die this time, it's actually for real."

Stacy tried not to think about his comment. Stumbling forward, she grabbed a handrail for balance as the boat crested a wave and came crashing down into the trough.

"Remind me why we can't just launch from land again?" she asked Russell.

"Murdoch was pretty evasive when I asked," he replied. "I suspect that FEDSEC hasn't been made fully aware of the purpose of the orbital ring. They think it's an interstellar radio or something."

Stacy nodded. If she had learned anything about the Federal Department of Social Emotional Calibration, it was that they were best kept in the dark.

"Well, you'd think they'd have given us a bigger boat," she grumbled.

"Too visible," he shrugged. "Just be grateful we have a cabin this time."

Stacy groaned, laid down on the floor, and shut her eyes. She was pretty sure her monkeybot couldn't vomit, but it sure felt like it wanted to.

---

She was woken by Vincent's voice crackling over the radio. "Approaching the launchpad!" he announced.

She clambered to her feet and made her way to join Russell at the front of the cabin. "See it?" she asked, staring out into the blackness beyond.

"Nothing," he responded.

She pressed her face to the glass, trying to make out any shapes in the dark, moonless night. She might as well have been blindfolded.

Without warning, the boat thudded and came to a sudden stop. Her face smacked against the window. It hurt, just like a real face would have.

"You have arrived at your destination," Vincent announced.

"Couldn't have brought it in more smoothly?" Russell asked, picking himself off the floor.

"Be thankful you got there," Vincent muttered. "I'd like to see you navigate here without GPS."

Stacy stayed out of the argument. Navigating to a raft in the middle of the ocean was one thing. Navigating to a vanished star in the outer reaches of the galaxy was a whole other challenge.

She opened the cabin door and stepped out with Russell onto the deck. As her eyes adjusted to the low light, she made out her home for the next three months - a house-sized black cylinder lying on its side, above which loomed an enormous balloon.

Russell pointed at one end of the cylinder. "Fusion rockets," he explained. Then, panning over to the other end of the cylinder, he said "living quarters."

Picking up his bag, he walked towards the living quarters. Stacy nodded to no one in particular, and followed.

"What do you mean, I have to accelerate it? I need to slow the shuttle down to drop the tether," crackled Vincent's annoyed voice on the radio.

"It's relative, remember?" replied an exasperated Xavier. "To slow down relative to you, the shuttle needs to speed up relative to the ring."

"This is terrible UX," Vincent grumbled.

"You do realize that the orbital ring is spinning, right? It's in the name. It orbits."

"Who designed this interface? Don't tell me you did it."

"Come on, dad. It's not that bad."

"A chicken could have done a better job."

"Dad-"

"I'm serious. Next time you need to make a user interface, just grab a chicken and scatter some grain on a keyboard. It'll produce a more usable design."

The father/son duo had been bickering on the shared line for ten minutes. Stacy drummed her fingers nervously and glanced at Russell, who responded with a look that said "man, I really hope these idiots figure this out." Stacy reflected for a moment on the expressive realism of his monkeybot's prosthetic face, before turning her attention to the window. She could just make out the ocean, kilometers below the high altitude to which they'd risen with the balloon.

The faintest rays of sunshine were just starting to light up the sky. If Vincent and Xavier didn't get the launch mechanism figured out in the next few minutes, they'd lose the cover of darkness - and with it, any remaining pretense that the orbital ring was an interstellar radio antenna. FEDSEC would begin raids almost immediately. She could imagine them confiscating all electronic devices, which would imply the powering down of StevieNix and the death of everyone she loved. If Steve had thought to install sweat glands, her palms would be drenched right now.

Her wandering mind was snapped into the present by Vincent's excited voice. "Finally! Prepare for launch!" he announced.

She sighed in relief and looked again at Russell, who was tightening his straps on his five-point harness. She did the same while craning her neck upwards, trying to spot the descending tether in the dim morning light. All she could see was the enormous black balloon above them.

The spaceship clunked. "Tether attached," Vincent announced. "Now, let me guess - to take off, I have to decelerate the shuttle?"

"Correct," Xavier responded. "Because the ring is spinning."

Stacy could sense Vincent's paternalistic, teasing smile over the crackle of the radio. "Seriously, get a chicken" he replied. "It'll help. Anyway, hold on tight!"

The balloon released the ship, and Stacy let out an involuntary yelp as the support of her chair disappeared and the entire cabin entered a sickening freefall. A moment later, she was slammed back into her chair in a violent jerk as the tether taughtened. Kilometers above them, attached to the orbital ring, the shuttle started accelerating - or decelerating, or whatever.

"Oof," groaned Russell. "This sucks."

Stacy struggled to reply. Once again praying that her monkeybot didn't have the ability to puke, she closed her eyes and gripped her armrests. Bracing against the enormous g-forces, she and Russell hung on for dear life as the craft was yanked up through the atmosphere and flung out into space.
