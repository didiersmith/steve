## 0. Human Rights

Archibald reluctantly led Stacy II, Filbert, and Cosmo to his village. When they arrived, the ceremony was already underway.

A woman in her forties, clad in a crude and skimpy leather approximation of a pencil skirt and blouse, was standing on a rock at the head of the square. A crowd of a dozen boys and men of every age stood in the square, looking up at her and jeering. A long flower garland was strung between two poles, separating the woman from the crowd.

A hefty man, whom Stacy II assumed to be Archibald's stepfather, was addressing the crowd, recounting the achievements of the individuals therein.

"And Blake! Who remembers the time Blake had that head-to-head with a mountain goat? We all thought he was dead for sure!"

The crowd laughed and directed their attentions to a tall, stooped man in his 30s, presumably Blake.

"When he grabbed the goat and started rolling down the hill with it in a chokehold, I was like 'oh man, now I have to find a new chandler. This one's broken.'"

More laughter.

"But he reached the bottom of the hill and stood right up, with his arm still wrapped around that goat's neck, didn't he? And we all had goat stew and goat tallow candles for days, didn't we?"

Cheers from the crowd. A couple of people clapped Blake on his back.

"What a guy, I tell you! What a guy. Does he deserve celibacy?"

Enthusiastic boos and "nos" emanated from the crowd.

"Or does he deserve human rights?"

The crowd chanted, "Human rights! Human rights!"

"Don't we all deserve human rights?"

"Human rights! Human rights!"

Archibald's stepfather waited for the crowd to quiet, strode over to the garland, and pulled a bone dagger out from somewhere in his furs. He smiled at his erstwhile wife, who glared at him in return.

Holding the garland in one hand and the dagger in the other, he turned to face the crowd and announced, "By the authority vested in me, I hereby bequeath this resource to the public. It shall be public property, to be shared by all, for the good of the common man." He cut the garland, allowed the two halves to fall to the poles, stepped backwards, and wrapped his arm around the woman's legs to the sound of cheers and applause from the audience.

"Now," he asked, "who wants to have the first crack at her, eh?"

From their hiding spot behind a hut, Stacy II whispered to Filbert. "Shoot him!"

"What, now?" Filbert asked, incredulously. "You couldn't have asked for that thirty seconds ago?"

"The timing has to be right!"

"I don't have a clear shot!"

"It wouldn't have had the same effect thirty seconds ago!"

"It won't have the same effect either if I blow her head off, okay?"

Stacy II balled her fists. Just as Filbert was starting to work his way into her good graces, he had to revert to his old ways. "Shut up, man up, and just aim better!"

Filbert sighed, raised his railgun, and stepped out from behind the hut. He depressed the aiming trigger, and tried his best to relax. Fortunately, Archibald's stepfather was a substantially larger target than his mother, and the railgun's computer locked onto his radiant heat signature with ease.

In his final moment, Archibald's stepfather noticed Filbert, standing in the open, with his railgun aimed towards him. He opened his mouth to object, and his torso imploded as the hypersonic projectile slammed into his chest and threw him off his feet. 

The crowd was splattered with blood. Archibald's mother was showered in it. No one said a word.

Stacy II strode out from behind the hut, railgun held lazily at her side. Cosmo followed, waddling awkwardly on his talons. "Say the line," she whispered icily to Filbert as she passed him.

"All hail her royal highness, Queen Stacy the Second!" recited Filbert loudly.

The confused and blood-splattered crowd turned to face the newcomers, and recoiled at the sight of the dinosaur. They shouted and scattered to the edges of the square, leaving the path between the trio and Archibald's mother deserted. Stacy II and her entourage walked up to take the position at the head of the square. Archibald's mother, similarly leery of the ketzel and its accompanying strangers, jumped off her rock and ran away to mild objections from the crowd.

"Go on," Stacy II said to Cosmo, nodding at the stepfather's fresh corpse. Having already eaten a large meal a few hours ago, Cosmo was notably less enthusiastic this time round. Nonetheless, he happily ripped the corpse apart with his beak and talons and nibbled away at the choicer cuts and organs. This still had the desired effect on the audience.

"Hello, everyone!" Stacy II announced over the sound of Cosmo's culinary activities. "I am your queen, Stacy the Second."

The crowd grumbled.

"I am here to offer you a deal."

The crowd silenced.

"It has come to my attention," she announced, "that you live under an oppressive regime. The House of Lords, who sits in the city, taxing your children and treating them as slaves."

There was little reaction from the audience. Stacy II had suspected that this would happen. The majority of citizens of New Australia were likely not taxpayers and benefited from the redistributive policies of the regime. Time to try a different approach.

"It has also come to my attention," she continued, "that you live in an impoverished hellhole with no natural resources and very few women."

More reaction this time, mostly grumbling.

"Fortunately, it doesn't have to be this way forever! My mother sent you here, but her reign is over. My first act as queen shall be to pardon all of you!"

The crowd murmured cautiously, as its participants waited for the catch.

"What I ask in return is for your service. Help me unite the tribes of New Australia under my banner, and retake the throne of the Theocratic Dominion. In return, I'll grant you land, and a place in civilization."

The crowd exploded into heated muttering.

"So you aren't really queen, then?" asked a voice in the audience.

"What?" asked Stacy II.

The speaker stepped forward. He was a larger man in his forties, and was missing several teeth. "Well, you're not in charge here, because the House of Lords is in charge here. And it sounds like you're not in charge of the TD either, because you want us to retake it for you. So unless I'm missing something, you're not really in charge of anything. Which means you're not really queen."

Stacy II glared. "I'm in charge of him," she responded, pointing at Filbert. "Filbert, shoot this man."

Filbert sighed and stepped forward. He raised his railgun, and the crowd burst into protest.

"Whoa whoa whoa!" exclaimed the man, raising his hands. "I'm very sorry your majesty, I didn't mean nothing by it! Just trying to wrap me head around the situation, is all. I'm a bit thick you see, takes me a minute to get up to speed on things."

Stacy glared at him for a few seconds before giving Filbert an ambiguous nod, which he charitably chose to interpret as "spare this man's life" rather than "proceed with the execution."

"If you don't like the carrot, there's always the stick," Stacy growled at the man.

He nodded and stepped backwards into the crowd, subdued.

"The circumstances surrounding my rule may be temporarily out of step with the ideal," she announced through gritted teeth, "but my divine right is not in question. Anyone who believes otherwise is welcome to nourish Cosmo." She jerked her thumb towards the ketzel, who was picking the meatier bits from Archibald's stepfather's face.

"Anyone who wishes to accept my offer, step forwards and kneel for your queen. Anyone else will be shot. Think carefully."

One by one, the men of the crowd stepped forwards and knelt for their queen.
