## 0. Human Rights

Stacy II followed a reluctant Archibald to his village, with Filbert and Gabe in tow. When they arrived, the ceremony was already underway.

A woman in her forties, clad in a crude and skimpy leather approximation of a pencil skirt and blouse, was standing on a rock at the head of the square. A crowd of a dozen boys and men of every age stood in the square, looking up at her and jeering. A long flower garland was strung between two poles, separating the woman from the crowd.

A hefty man, whom Stacy II assumed to be Archibald's stepfather, was addressing the crowd, recounting the achievements of the individuals therein.

"And Blake! Who remembers the time Blake had that head-to-head with a mountain goat? We all thought he was dead for sure!"

The crowd laughed and directed their attentions to a tall, handsome man in his early 30s, presumably Blake.

"When he grabbed the goat and started rolling down the hill with it in a chokehold, I was like 'oh man, now I have to find a new chandler. This one's broken.'"

More laughter.

"But he reached the bottom of the hill and stood right up, with his arm still wrapped around that goat's neck, didn't he? And we all had goat stew and goat tallow candles for days, didn't we?"

Cheers from the crowd. A couple of people clapped Blake on his back.

"What a guy, I tell you! What a guy. Does he deserve celibacy?"

Enthusiastic boos and "nos" emanated from the crowd.

"Or does he deserve human rights?"

The crowd chanted, "Human rights! Human rights!"

"Don't we all deserve human rights?"

"Human rights! Human rights!"

Archibald's stepfather waited for the crowd to quiet, strode over to the garland, and pulled a bone dagger out from somewhere in his furs. He smiled at his erstwhile wife, who glared at him in return.

Holding the garland in one hand and the dagger in the other, he turned to face the crowd and announced, "By the authority vested in me, I hereby bequeath this resource to the public. It shall be public property, to be shared by all, for the good of the common man." He cut the garland, allowed the two halves to fall to the poles, stepped backwards, and wrapped his arm around the woman's legs to the sound of cheers and applause from the audience.

"Now," he asked, "who wants to have the first crack at her, eh?"

From their hiding spot behind a hut, Stacy II whispered to Filbert. "Shoot him!"

"What, now?" Filbert asked. "You couldn't have asked for that thirty seconds ago?"

"The timing has to be right! For effect!"

"What do you think the effect is going to be if I miss and blow her head off?"

Stacy II balled her fists. Just as Filbert was starting to work his way into her good graces, he had to revert to his old ways. "Just shut up and aim better!"

She watched as her recalcitrant assistant sighed, raised his railgun, and stepped out from hehind the hut. He aimed, and shot Archibald's stepfather in the chest. It really wasn't difficult a shot. What was he complaining about?

The crowd was splattered with blood. Archibald's mother was showered in bits of guts and screamed. No one else said a word.

Stacy II strode out from behind the hut, railgun held lazily at her side. "Say the line," she whispered icily to Filbert as she passed him.

"All hail her royal highness, Queen Stacy the Second!" recited Filbert loudly.

The confused and blood-splattered crowd scattered to the edges of the square, leaving the path between Stacy II and Archibald's mother deserted. She and Filbert walked up to take the position at the head of the square. Archibald's mother, leery of the strangers, jumped off her rock and ran away to mild objections from the crowd.

"Hello, everyone!" Stacy II announced. "I am your queen, Stacy the Second."

The crowd grumbled.

"I am here to offer you a deal."

The crowd silenced.

"It has come to my attention," she announced, "that you live under an oppressive regime. The House of Lords, who sits in the city, taxing your children and treating them as slaves."

There was little reaction from the audience. Stacy II had suspected that this would happen. The majority of citizens of New Australia were likely not taxpayers and benefited from the redistributive policies of the regime. Time to try a different approach.

"It has also come to my attention," she continued, "that you live in an impoverished hellhole with no natural resources and very few women."

More reaction this time, mostly grumbling.

"Fortunately, it doesn't have to be this way forever! My mother sent you here, but her reign is over. My first act as queen shall be to pardon all of you!"

The crowd murmured cautiously, as its participants waited for the catch.

"What I ask in return is for your service. Help me unite the tribes of New Australia under my banner, and retake the throne of the Theocratic Dominion. In return, I'll grant you land, and a place in civilization."

The crowd exploded into heated muttering.

"So you aren't really queen, then?" asked a voice in the audience.

"What?" asked Stacy II.

The speaker stepped forward. He was a larger man in his forties, and was missing several teeth. "Well, you're not in charge here, because the House of Lords is in charge here. And it sounds like you're not in charge of the TD either, because you want us to retake it for you. So unless I'm missing something, you're not really in charge of anything. Which means you're not really queen."

Stacy II glared. "I'm in charge of him," she responded, pointing at Filbert. "Filbert, shoot this man."

Filbert sighed and stepped forward. He raised his railgun, and the crowd burst into protest.

"Whoa whoa whoa!" exclaimed the man, raising his hands. "I'm very sorry your majesty, I didn't mean nothing by it! Just trying to wrap me head around the situation, is all. I'm a bit thick you see, takes me a minute to get up to speed on things."

Stacy glared at him for a few seconds before giving Filbert an ambiguous nod, which he appeared to charitably interpret as "spare this man's life" rather than "proceed with the execution."

"If you don't like the carrot, I have plenty of sticks" Stacy growled at the man.

He nodded and stepped backwards into the crowd, subdued.

"The circumstances surrounding my rule may be temporarily out of step with the ideal," she announced through gritted teeth, "but my divine right is not in question. Anyone who believes otherwise is welcome to take it up with the Lord."

The crowd muttered.

"Anyone who wishes to accept my offer, step forwards and kneel for your queen. The rest of you will be shot. Think carefully."

One by one, the men of the crowd stepped forwards and knelt for their queen.

"Draw me a map," she demanded of Blake. "Showing all the villages in New Australia and how easy it will be to conquer them."

"Right," Blake said. "A map."

He didn't move. Stacy II looked at him expectantly. Nothing. She looked at Archibald, who was displaying a similarly blank expression.

"What is that?" Blake asked. "Your royal highness."

"Oh, for goodness' sake."

Eventually, through her interrogations, she was able to get a rough idea of what tribes had formed on the island, and how easy it would be to conquer each one. They both reckoned the easist would be the Pacifists. As for the hardest, they disagreed on whether it was the House of Lords, or the Anarcho-Cannibalists.

"The Anarcho-Cannibalists?" she asked.

"They eat people," Archibald explained.

"Why?"

Archibald shrugged. Blake chimed in.

"They call it 'restorative justice,'" he explained. "Restore nutrients to the collective. Justice served, medium rare."

Stacy II gagged. "We'll have to put an end to that."

"You can do that on your own," Archibald said. "I ain't goin' anywhere near those psychos."

Blake nodded. "Even the House of Lords doesn't bother them. Last time they sent a tax collector, they sent back his bones. Picked clean."

Stacy II decided to start with the Pacifists.
