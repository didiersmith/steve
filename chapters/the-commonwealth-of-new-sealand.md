## 0. The Commonwealth of New Sealand

At last! Stacy was starting to prove her worth. With Russell's help, she was finally using the MHI-10 as intended - social media outreach. Not to bring people to the faith, though. That would have made too much sense. Instead, she used it to bring people to New Sealand.

Friggin' apes, seriously. Why do they always need to do everything the hard way?

Steve listened in on the immigrants' thoughts, trying to figure out if they were aligned or not. Hard to say. On the one hand, they all understood that New Sealand existed because of him. Stacy was good about giving him credit. On the other hand, it felt like most of the apes couldn't care less about whose divine intervention enabled the island. The idiots just wanted to hang out with Stacy in a tropical paradise.

The easiest way to sort them would be to fast-forward a couple decades, see who's still a believer then. Steve hovered his cursor over the speed slider, but decided against it. He wanted to watch the show.

He zoomed in on Murdoch's islander, Vincent. Man, that guy was a good pick. What a workhorse. It looked like he'd put together a crew. Not only had they covered the planet with transport tunnels called "hyperloops," but they were churning out islands like assembly line workers. Fully terraformed, fully planted, with buildings and utilities included. The islands floated like enormous hexagonal icebergs, stabilized with deep keels and massive balls of lead. 

He scrolled over to where a city was being built across a group of islands. The islands tessalated together like honeycomb - hence, the hexagons. Vincent had thought this through. The city would probably be able to house...say, a hundred thousand apes. Not bad at all. 

A notification popped up on Steve's screen. Incoming prayer, from Roommate Russ. Steve hadn't made his mind up about him - on the one hand, he was writing an updated holy book, the Newer Testament. That was a good idea! On the other hand, his constant questioning was starting to get really annoying.

Steve accepted the call.

"How do you think we should make people get along?" Roommate Russ asked. "We're seeing more and more...interpersonal friction."

"Really?" Steve acted shocked. "The warfaring AIs that I deliberately made as aggressive as possible, are exhibiting 'interpersonal friction?'"

The sarcasm went over Roommate Russ's head. "A fight broke out over the stupidest thing yesterday. Someone insulted a pig or something. Now these two families are threatening to kill each other."

Kill each other, eh? Steve looked at his empty credit counter. He could do with a few deaths. "Is that something you're trying to avoid?"

"Didn't you say yourself, 'thou shalt not kill?'"

"I said a lot of things."

"Goddamn it, Steve! Are you saying that sustainable peace is impossible due to our very nature?"

Steve shrugged off the foul language. Sometimes, the apes found it hard to control their internal monologues - no biggie. "I didn't design you to pick flowers," he replied.

"I don't believe you. People are fundamentally good. We're not just warfaring monkeys - we've evolved beyond that. I'll show you."

"Warfaring monkeys were literally the design spec, Russ."

"I'll show you!"

Steve rolled his eyes and hung up the prayer. Whatever, Russ.

Russell clenched his fists in frustration. The others didn't think much of his idea either.

"It's stupid," Stacy said. "You can't just fix all our problems with an app."

"It's not just an app!" Russell objected. "It's on the blockchain!"

"You can't just fix all our problems with the blockchain."

"At least hear me out!"

Stacy and Vincent looked at each other and sighed.

"Okay," said Vincent. "Let's hear it."

This was it - the big reveal. The post-scarcity society. Russell launched into his explanation: A direct democracy, where everything was decided on the blockchain. Legislation? Blockchain. Elections? Blockchain. Constitutional amendments? Blockchain.

He wasn't even half done when Vincent interrupted. "Sounds really dumb."

"I agree," said Stacy. "Aggregating human stupidity on the blockchain doesn't make people smarter."

Infuriating. "People are smart!" said Russell. "And I'm not done! We'll also have universal basic income."

The other two burst out laughing.

"Paying people just for being alive," Vincent snickered. "That's too funny."

"Could the bar be any lower?" Stacy asked.

"I guess you could pay people for being dead."

Stacy and Vincent broke out into uncontrollable laugher and took turns making more lame jokes. Idiots, honestly. Did he have to do everything himself?

"I have a better idea," Stacy said. "You ready?"

"Go on, then," Russell said.

"Queen Stacy."

Ah. Stacy and her whole-of-society solution again. "Monarchies are discredited."

Stacy waved him off. "It'll be easy. I'll solve all our problems in like, ten minutes. Fighting? Illegal. Importing weird chemicals? Illegal. Not having kids? Not being aligned with Steve? All illegal, all crimes punishable by hanging."

"Last time we tried this, the kings all kept inbreeding and getting syphilis."

"Queen," Stacy corrected him. "I'm basically queen already. Everyone moved here because of me. If I told them to go hang someone, they'd do it. You know it.

Russell stared at her face. Stone-cold. Dead serious. "Can you tell her?" he asked Vincent.

Vincent shrugged. "It's better than your idea," he said. "If she does a bad job, the peasants can just behead her."

"How does that sound, Stacy? Getting beheaded in a peasant revolt?"

"Unlikely," Stacy said. "I'll do a great job."

Russell rolled his eyes and turned back to Vincent. "You can't seriously be on board with this."

"I'm not. I just said that it's better than your idea. Stacy's proposing a tyranny with one ruler. You're proposing a tyranny where you're ruled by the entire population. If _that_ goes wrong...well, there aren't enough guillotines in the world."

This was going nowhere. "Well, what do you suggest then?"

Vincent smiled. "No government," he said. "Everyone gets guns. Rules are enforced by vigilante lynch mobs."

Of course. Why had he even asked?

They argued through the night. In the end, they couldn't agree. A compromise was struck. The Commonwealth of New Sealand would be split into three separate entities - Russell's People's Republic, Stacy's Theocratic Dominion, and Vincent's Anarchy. 

Not exactly the result Russell had hoped for, but not too bad either. Obviously, the People's Republic would win. He just hoped the other entities wouldn't do too much damage on the way out.
