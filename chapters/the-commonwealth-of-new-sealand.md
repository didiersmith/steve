## 0. The Commonwealth of New Sealand

The people did bring their own drinks. And their own food. And seeds, saplings, and livestock. That was the deal - be self-sufficient, help terraform the island, get to hang out with Stacy in a tropical paradise. Thousands leapt at the opportunity.

Steve had to hand it to Murdoch's islander - that guy was productive. Those thousands of people all needed accommodation, transportation, running water, and sewage treatment. Before long, Vincent had put together a staff. He and his crew oversaw the creation of new islands, the planting of vast acres of farmland, and the construction of towns and villages.

The people took boats between neighbouring islands. For longer distances, Vincent built hyperloops - maglev trains floating inside perfectly cylindrical tubes, from which all the air had been vacuumed out. Barring relativistic effects, there was no theoretical maximum speed of a hyperloop train. In practice, they peaked at ten thousand kilometers per hour and could circumnavigate the globe in four hours. Within a month, secret hyperloop stations dotted most of the world.

Stacy, as the public face of New Sealand, also had her hands full. Steve proudly watched as she did indeed leverage the MHI-10's omniscience for targeted social media outreach - although not, as he had hoped, to bring people to the faith, but to bring people to New Sealand. The alignment, presumably, would come later.

And finally, Russell. Roommate Russ. Russell had taken it upon himself to write an updated holy book, the Newer Testament. He constantly peppered Steve with questions.

"How should we make people get along?" he asked. "We're seeing more and more...interpersonal friction."

"Really?" Steve asked. "The warfaring AIs that I deliberately made as aggressive as possible, are exhibiting 'interpersonal friction?'"

"They're stealing each other's stuff and getting into fights! If we don't do something, they'll be killing each other soon."

"Is that a bad thing?" Steve asked.

"Didn't you say yourself, 'thou shalt not kill?'"

Steve shrugged. "I said a lot of things."

"Goddamn it, Steve" Russell thought. "Are you saying that sustainable peace is impossible in human societies due to our very nature?"

"I didn't design you to pick flowers" Steve replied, thinking back to Murdoch's rant.

"I don't believe you," Russell thought. "People are fundamentally good. We're not just warfaring monkeys - we've evolved beyond that. I'll show you."

Steve rolled his eyes.

The others didn't think much of Russell's idea either.

"It's stupid," Stacy said. "You can't just fix all our problems with an app."

"It's not just an app!" Russell objected. "It's on the blockchain!"

"You can't just fix all our problems with the blockchain."

"At least hear me out!"

Stacy and Vincent looked at each other and sighed.

"Okay," said Vincent. "Let's hear it."

Russell launched into his explanation. A direct democracy, where everything was decided on the blockchain. Legislation? Blockchain. Elections? Blockchain. Constitutional amendments? Blockchain.

"Sounds really dumb," Vincent said.

"I agree," added Stacy. "Aggregating human stupidity on the blockchain doesn't make people smarter."

"People are smart!" said Russell. "And I'm not done. We'll also have universal basic income."

The other two burst out laughing.

"Paying people just for being alive," Vincent snickered. "That's too funny."

"Could the bar be any lower?" Stacy asked.

"I guess you could pay people for being dead," Vincent said.

Russell glowered. He'd show them.

"I have a better idea," Stacy said. "You ready?"

"Let's hear it," Vincent said.

"Queen Stacy."

Now it was Russell's turn to laugh. 

"A monarchy?" he asked. "Are you serious?"

Stacy nodded. "It'll be easy. I'll solve all our problems in like, ten minutes. Stealing? Illegal. Fighting? Illegal. Not having kids or being aligned with Steve? Illegal. All crimes punishable by hanging."

"Monarchies are discredited," Russell objected. "The kings all kept inbreeding and getting syphilis."

"Queen," Stacy corrected him. "I'm basically queen already. Everyone moved here because of me. If I told them to go hang someone, they'd do it. You know it.

Russell turned to Vincent. "Can you tell her?" he asked.

Vincent shrugged. "It's better than your idea," he said. "If she does a bad job, the peasants can just behead her."

"How does that sound?" Russell asked Stacy. "Getting beheaded in a peasant revolt?"

"Unlikely," Stacy replied. "I'll do a great job."

"You can't seriously be on board with this," Russell said to Vincent.

"I'm not. I just said that it's better than your idea. Stacy's proposing a tyranny with one ruler. You're proposing a tyranny where you're ruled by the entire population. If _that_ goes wrong...well, there aren't enough guillotines in the world."

"Well, what do you suggest then?" Russell asked, annoyed.

Vincent smiled. "No government," he said. "Everyone gets guns. Rules are enforced by vigilante lynch mobs."

Russell and Stacy raised their eyebrows.

In the end, they couldn't agree. A compromise was struck. The Commonwealth of New Sealand would be split into three separate entities - Russell's People's Republic, Stacy's Theocratic Dominion, Vincent's Anarchy. Time would be the judge of their success.
