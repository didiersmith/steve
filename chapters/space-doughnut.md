## 0. Space Doughnut

"Are they going to vivisect us?" Stacy asked Russell as their ship was winched in towards the doughnut.

"Nah," responded Russell nervously. "Why would they do that?"

Stacy looked at him blankly, as if the answer was self-evident. "They're aliens," she stated flatly.

"We're much more interesting to experiment on if they keep us alive," Russell replied.

The doughnut continued to approach and take up more of their field of view. Before long, it was all either of them could see.

"How big do you think it is?" Stacy asked.

Russell shook his head as he watched the doughnut grow. "It's gotta be the size of a city," he mused. "Canberra, maybe."

Stacy nodded. "There's still time to fire up the rocket," she suggested. "I bet our ship is stronger than the tether."

"Don't you want to see what's inside?"

Stacy bit her rubbery lip. Of course, a part of her wanted to see what was inside the Canberra-sized space doughnut attached to the Tasmania-sized parachute. The other part - the part that had ensured the survival of millions of generations of her ancestors, was less enthusiastic.

An enormous port opened on the top of the doughnut, revealing a dark cavern into which the tether disappeared.

"Guess I don't have much of a choice," Stacy conceded.

The ship was reeled into the recess, and the universe disappeared. A few moments later, the craft stopped with a sudden _thud_. As the artificial gravity kicked in, the two monkeybots were thrown to the floor.

"No sign of life on the scans," announced an unfamiliar voice. "Maybe it's a probe?"

"Maybe it's a bomb," suggested another voice. "You can't be too careful with those Rotarian bastards."

Stacy and Russell huddled together in the corner of the bridge, trying to make themselves as small as possible. Stacy prayed that the intruders would leave, before remembering that prayer no longer did anything. Her God was six weeks away and powerless to intervene - up here in the afterlife, Steve was just a regular guy.

"A lot of empty space for a bomb," continued the first voice. "And a pair of beds. Why does a bomb need beds?"

As she listened to the alien intruders stomp around the living quarters, Stacy was struck by the realization that she understood them. She looked at Russell, who had clearly had the same thought.

He stood up and offered a hand to help her up.

"We can talk our way out of this," he explained. "They're not going to vivisect people they can understand."

"Wishful thinking," Stacy responded, taking his hand and pulling herself up. "Aliens do messed up stuff all the time."

"They can't actually be-" Russell started.

The door opened and in walked the aliens.

Stacy's jaw dropped. Her mind raced to make sense of what she was seeing. The aliens looked exactly like Steve's people. Shorter and stockier than Steve and Gabe, but definitely the same species. They reminded her of Murdoch. Now that she thought about it, they sounded like him too. What was going on?

"Holy God above!" exclaimed the owner of the first voice, reeling backwards. "What the hell are those?"

His partner drew some sort of firearm and raised it at the two monkeybots. "Shall I shoot them?" he asked.

"I'd rather you didn't," said Stacy.

Both aliens jumped at the sound of her voice and the second one dropped his gun.

"Feck!" he exclaimed.
