#26. Robot Laser Arachnid 1

It started with precision manufacturing. Vincent, as an avid CNC manufacturing hobbyist, already owned a CNC router, a cheap laser engraver, and two 3D printers. He had two problems: Firstly, the tolerances. His tools couldn't machine anything more precisely than 0.1 millimeters which was far, far too sloppy. Better equipment could easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and still wouldn't meet the precision required. More importantly, however, was the manual labour. Machining parts was hard enough, but manufacturing at scale was a whole other challenge.

Fortunately, Vincent had an omniscient chatbot at his fingertips. He had Russell help him make an audio/video interface to the chatbot that he could run on his phone, and took it around every junkyard and electronics recycling depot in Perth. He returned home with a trailer full of consumer electronics and discarded industrial equipment. He took over their two-car garage, and spent the next several days designing in tandem with the LLM, while deconstructing junk, desoldering surface-mounted devices, manufacturing parts, and assembling pieces into a Frankenstein's monster of servos, lasers, and electronics.

"I need to add a selective laser sintering head."

"Certainly! What materials will you need to sinter?"

"All the common metals. Copper, aluminium, steel, tungsten, titanium."

"This is what we collected the industrial printer for. I must advise you, even though this is quite a powerful laser by printer standards, it will be quite slow at sintering."

"That's okay, tell me where to find it."

"The printer is on the left side of the bottom shelf. To access the laser, start by removing the front cover..."

Eventually, his robot began to take form. It looked like a huge mechanical spider designed by a fourteen year old in Minecraft. Its body was roughly the size and shape of a desktop computer. It was able to support itself on as few as three of its eight hinged limbs, while it used its remaining five to manipulate objects and tools. It was equipped with every tool necessary to manufacture itself, and more - its blocky body contained a heat gun, several pairs of pliers, a 3D printer head, a router with a selection of endmills, a soldering iron, many different types of laser, a selection of power tools, and a TIG welding torch.

On top of its body, it held hoppers of sintering powder and spools of ABS plastic, solder, and welding wire. A power cable and an ethernet cable ran from it to the ceiling, where they dangled from a large, hinged arm that Vincent had designed to follow the robot's movements around the workshop. Next to them were an array of ports, to which the robot could attach various hoses for compressed air, argon gas, and a dust extractor.

It was covered in cameras. There were ten mounted on the body alone, and one or two on each of its eight limbs, ensuring that it always had full view from every angle of any object it was manipulating. Vincent had originally thought that the cameras would be superfluous - after all, the ethernet cable connected the robot to an omniscient computer - but communication to the MHI-10 still involved at least a couple of hops on the unacceptably laggy terrestrial internet.

The system was thus designed to run completely offline, with only occasional help from the LLM. Every inch of the body not filled with tools was crammed full of electronics - salvaged circuit boards, GPUs and microcontrollers, all wired together in an incomprehensible warren of wires and fiber optics that made sense only to the LLM. The software - the most complex part of the entire construction - had almost no human involvement in its creation whatsoever. Vincent simply prompted the LLM to generate the appropriate firmware, flashed the resultant machine code onto the robot's various computers, and prayed.

Eventually, with trepidation, Vincent turned the robot on.

It stood up, proudly and symmetrically, on its eight limbs. Status LEDs flashed green. The previously silent garage was filled with the whine of cooling fans.

"Make it fabricate a plywood smiley face, 50mm in diameter", instructed Vincent to the LLM on his phone.

At once, the robot leapt into action. Ignoring the corner of the workshop where Vincent kept his plywood stock, it scuttled past him to the trash can and dove in. It emerged a moment later, almost tipping over the trash can, holding a rough plywood offcut. Elegantly vaulting up onto his workbench, the robot manoeuvered the plywood piece directly underneath itself, clamped it in place with three of its limbs, and pulled a laser out from its body. Vincent barely had time to shield his eyes before a bright red light flashed, and smoke began to rise from the plywood. Then, without moving its body or the piece of wood, the robot reached one limb above itself, grabbed the dust extractor hose, plugged it into itself, and turned the extractor on. Finally, it swapped out the laser for the router, and, sequentially moving its "clamping" legs out of the way, started cutting the wood.

The entire process was done in under ten seconds. The robot scuttled away from its workpiece, and Vincent edged forward cautiously to inspect the plywood. He found a precise 50mm diameter circle, smoke still rising from the laser-engraved smiley face. As he picked up the pieces, he noticed that, although the two pieces came apart without resistance, there was no circular marking on the workbench where the router had cut through. The robot had guided the cut perfectly.

"Holy moly," breathed Vincent. "Wow."

He brought his phone up to his mouth. "Make it fabricate a remote control toy car."

Within two minutes, a maniacally laughing Vincent, newly fabricated remote control in his hands, was driving a miniature cobbled-together car around his garage.
