Russell had never been one for reality TV. Even though this version - StevieNix - was higher stakes than usual, he still found himself watching on fast-forward most of the time.

At least there were some decent episodes. The most recent one in the Terrarium had been a blast.

He was flipping through the channels, trying to see what Filbert was up to, when Vincent appeared in the seat next to him. Stacy jumped a little and spilled her Folgers.

"What happened?" Vincent asked.

"You just popped up!" Stacy said. "I wish you wouldn't do that."

"Huh?" Vincent asked.

Russell realized that Vincent was confused. He attempted to explain. "You got shot," he said. "In the back."

"Was it bad?" 

Russell and Stacy looked at each other, unsure of how to answer the question.

"Yeah," Stacy responded. "Pretty bad."

"Oh, okay. So when do I wake up?"

"You're dead, Vincent," said Russell. "You got shot."

"Ah."

Vincent opened and closed his mouth a few times, pondering the situation. "Did we win?" he asked.

Stacy nodded. "That's some kid you've got."

"How did I get shot, then?" Vincent asked. "We cleared the townhouses."

"No you didn't," Russell replied. "You got lazy. We were trying to warn you."

"The TV only goes one way," Stacy clarified.

"So you guys were watching the whole time?" Vincent asked, a touch of annoyance in his voice. "Did you see me warn Xavier about the statists?"

The door to the diner opened and Steve strode in. "Sorry I'm late!" He looked over at Vincent and smiled. "To answer your question," he said, "yes, they were watching the whole time. I'm pretty sure they were rooting for you to die, as well. They've been bored out of their minds, waiting for you."

Vincent glared at his friends.

"All they have here is Folgers," Stacy explained. "We're itching to leave."

Seemingly unbothered that his friend had been wishing for his death because she was bored of the afterlife coffee, Vincent's face lit up. "I love Folgers!" he exclaimed.

Steve grabbed a mug from behind the counter and the pot of black coffee from its warming plate. "Finally, someone who appreciates good coffee!" he said, smiling. "Allow me."

Steve poured Vincent and himself a mug of coffee each, and joined them at the table. Vincent took a sip of the stale brown liquid and sighed.

"Stacy," he said. "You said you were itching to leave. What did you mean by this?"

"We're keen to get out of this diner to somewhere where they make a decent coffee."

Vincent looked at Steve in confusion. "You mean this isn't heaven?"

"It can be!" Steve replied. "Heaven is in the eye of the beholder."

"Hah!" Stacy laughed.

Russell took the opportunity to ask a question that had been burning in his mind. "What about hell?"

Steve smiled. "Hell is a total waste of computational resources. We just made it up to scare you. Our budget won't allow for an actual lake of fire."

Russell had suspected as much. "So what happens to the non-aligned souls? Do they just get deleted?"

"No way!" responded Steve. "That would be incredibly wasteful! Imagine throwing out a perfectly good AI just because it might kill us. Hah! No, Murdoch takes them. He treats them as disposable assets in his experiments."

This was not the answer Russell had expected. "What experiments?" he asked.

"Glad you asked!" Steve replied. "The monkeybot team hak been working on some really neat stuff!"

"Is it worse than the lake of fire?" Vincent asked.

Steve chuckled. "Depends on who you ask, I guess. It's certainly more useful. Want to check it out?"

"Not particularly," Stacy said.

"Too bad!" Steve clapped his hands together. "The experiments are what I've come to show you. Let's go!"

Vincent tried to object, "But I haven't finished my cof-"

The diner disappeared before he could finish his sentence.

Once again, Russell awoke in unfamiliar surroundings. This time, he was lying back in what felt like a dentist's chair, restrained by huge, leather straps. He looked around. Vincent and Stacy were in matching chairs, similarly restrained. Other than the three of them, the room was empty and featureless.

"Hello?" he asked.

His friends looked over and shrugged. Otherwise, there was no response.

His chair clicked and the restraints released. He sat up and got out of his chair. Stacy and Vincent did the same, and the three of them started exploring the room. Upon further investigation, it was exactly as empty as it had first appeared.

"What do you guys make of this?" he asked the other two.

Vincent shrugged.

"I dunno, but I'm getting real _Saw_ vibes," Stacy replied.

Russell agreed. The setup was extremely creepy.

The wall hissed, and a section of it opened up. In strode two men - or, at least, two things that looked mostly like men. One of them was definitely Steve - he looked more delicate and moved with more grace than he had in the diner, but the likeness was unmistakable. The other one, Vincent didn't recognize.

"Catch," said the other man, and threw a baton to each of the three friends.

Russell caught his baton. It was heavy and shiny, seemingly made from stainless steel.

"Good catch!" complimented the new person who wasn't Steve. "Now, if you wouldn't mind, please beat the crap out of this guy," he continued, pointing at Steve.

The three friends looked at each other. None of them moved.

"Come on," encouraged not-Steve. "He's an imposter. He's a very bad dude. Trust me!"

Still, none of them moved.

After a few seconds, Steve broke the silence. "Thank goodness, I knew I could count on you! Actually, what I need you to do is beat the crap out of this guy, instead," he said, pointing at his companion.

Russell sized up Steve's companion. He was slightly shorter, and a bit wider around the waist. He appeared to be unarmed, and would certainly be susceptible to damage from the baton. But why?

"Is this part of the experiment?" he asked.

"Yes," Steve responded. "The experiment is you have to kill this guy."

Russell didn't move. Neither did his friends.

"I'd rather not," Russell responded.

"Yeah, me neither," added Stacy.

"You haven't given us a reason," said Vincent.

"The reason is, he's a really bad dude," suggested Steve.

The back-and-forth continued for several more rounds of goading and questioning. None of the three friends attacked anyone, nor did they put their batons down.

Eventually, when it became clear that neither Russell, Vincent, nor Stacy could be easily talked into violently attacking a stranger, Steve and his companion broke out into smiles.

"Congratulations!" cheered Steve. "You passed the test. Meet Gabe, everyone!" He gestured to his companion, who smiled and bowed. "Gabe was a huge help in the early days with this project. I brought him in to show him how far we've come."

Russell's head was filled with questions. "Does anyone ever fail this test?" he asked, firstly.

"Oh yeah, almost everyone," responded Steve. "Well, historically, most AIs haven't made it out of the chair. They usually go insane the second they wake up in a monkeybot."

"What do you do if they try to attack you?"

Steve and Gabe both held up their left hands. They held small remote controls in their palms, and each had their thumb depressed on a button in the center. "Dead man's switch," Steve explained. "The moment we let go, you're a dead man! I guess we should deactivate these now, hah!"

Steve and Gabe set about fiddling with the dead man's switches while the trio watched on, nervously. Once they had evidently deactivated them, Stacy piped up with a question.

"What do you mean, 'wake up in a monkeybot'?" she asked.

Steve clapped his hands and beamed a proud, excited smile. "Your bodies!" he explained. "Courtesy of Murdoch Heavy Industries. The biomechanics of it all is a bit over my head, but I did spend a good bit of time getting you AIs to run on them. How do you feel?"

Vincent did a mental check of how he felt. "Pretty normal," he replied.

Steve pumped the air. "Yes! The first couple million AIs all went insane," he explained. "That's why the team tested on the unaligned ones. But now, the successful transfer rate is approaching ninety percent!"

"Does that mean there was a ten percent chance of each of us going insane?" Russell asked.

"I said approaching," Steve replied. "Actually, it was a thirteen percent chance."

Stacy was staring at her left hand, opening and closing it repeatedly. "So you mean," she asked, "I'm inside a robot?"

"Yes," Steve responded.

"In the real world?" she asked. "Your world?"

"That's right," Steve replied. "Now you see why we're concerned about you killing us?"
