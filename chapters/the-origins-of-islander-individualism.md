## 0. The Origins of Islander Individualism

Murdoch sat alone in his office, drinking whiskey. He'd reached the end of his cigarette. He pulled another one from the pack on his desk, and lit it off the still-smoldering butt of the previous.

Compartmentalization was key to being an effective leader. The alignment guys didn't need to know about his hardware woes. As far as they were concerned, it was all being taken care of.

They didn't need to know he'd just fired the entire interstellar warship team. Completely useless, the lot of them.

"We need a launchpad!" he muttered to himself, mocking the whiny engineer who could never understand the need for discretion. "How will we get to space without a launchpad?"

He took a drag on his new cigarette, washed it down with a generous slug of whiskey, and set the tumbler down on his printed copy of Murdoch Heavy Industry's quarterly financial report. His accountant had printed it in colour to highlight the magnitude of the red numbers.

"The board is not going to like this," the weedy little beancounter had warned him. "R&D costs of this magnitude...they're going to want to hear how these expenses are going to generate a return."

"We have that interstellar radio contract," Murdoch had reassured him.

"You spent two thirds of MHI's cash reserves on a datacenter...to build a radio?"

"It'll generate return," Murdoch had said.

The look on the weedy nerd's face. Murdoch couldn't forget it. "We can't even write R&D costs of this size off on our taxes," the beancounter had objected.

Taxes! Who the feck could think of taxes at a time like this?

He took another drag on his cigarette and tried to clear his mind. At least the monkeybot team was making progress. That was another enormous source of R&D cost. The nerd had hated that too.

Feck. Good help was damn near impossible to find. How was he going to build another interstellar warship team? If only he had like, a thousand of himself.

His eyes wandered over to the StevieNix display on his computer, and a thought crossed his mind.

Hmm.

Shite. That didn't work at all.

In retrospect, he should have known that a "village of a thousand Murdochs" would be a fecking disaster. Murdoch was a lone wolf. Put a thousand of him in the same village...the gutters flowed with blood, piss, and whiskey.

Murdoch bit his lip and took a moment of silence to reflect on the failure of his experiment.

Then, lighting a fresh cigarette, he scrolled to the next island over and tried a new strategy.

"Kick him out," said the voice. "He's a smart kid. He's old enough to fend for himself. He'll do better on his own."

The islander looked at his son, in disbelief at his own thoughts. Kick his son out of the tribe? Why?

The tribe was life. The tribe was protection. The tribe was family. Everything was shared with the tribe. If he kicked his son out, surely he would starve, or be enslaved by some other tribe.

Plus, his son had done nothing wrong. If anything, he showed great promise. Sure, he spent a lot of time tinkering in the shed, trying to invent weird agricultural equipment. And sure, other people called him a "freeloading nerd" and had even beaten him up a time or two. But he wasn't a bad kid. He volunteered at church.

The islander thought for a while. Maybe he should kick him out.

He kicked him out.

The son didn't starve, and he wasn't enslaved. Instead, he sold one of his weird agricultural inventions. The resultant profit allowed him to hire a couple of freeloading nerds from other tribes. Together, they made and sold more agricultural equipment.

By the time the elder islander reached the end of his life, the son owned a factory and supplied agricultural equipment to half the island. Within a few generations, subsistence farming was a thing of the past. Everyone kicked their sons out when they reached working age, and there were no tribes left on the island.

Murdoch's individualist meme was cold and brutal. In the beginning, many starved. The long-term result, however, was unprecedented economic output.

The tribal apes had believed that the accumulation of capital was akin to the accumulation of power. This was inaccurate. In truth, the accumulation of capital was the accumulation of time. It was a harsh world, with bandits at the door and starvation round the corner, but excess capital could keep them away for some time. And if that time was spent on a successful venture? Some weird agricultural equipment that actually works? Suddenly, everybody wins.

The fecking beancounters never understood this. Return on investment wasn't just about numbers going up. Goans were broad. Society-wide. People who venture their capital are heroes. Everyone else should show some fecking gratitude.

Murdoch smoked his way through three packs of cigarettes as he watched the meme spread. By the time the islanders were ready to conquer the world, the sun was rising and his bottle of whiskey was empty. He fell asleep on his couch.
