# Chapter 2

Stars aren't supposed to "go out". The astronomy community was concerned. They stared at the spot where Sirius was supposed to be. It wasn't there. They scanned the region with their telescopes. Nothing detectable. Strange.

The global astronomy community consisted of so few people that all notable members would comfortably fit inside a hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant, if they felt so inclined. They didn't, and scheduled a meeting online. After twenty minutes of technical difficulties, people talking over each other, and attempts to converse with members who had clearly joined the call for appearances' sake only to turn off their cameras and walk away from their desks, Gabe was regretting his decision not to push harder for the restaurant. At least he could have gotten pho.

The following action items were recorded:

- Update star charts (Gabe)
- Press release?
  - Note: Need reassuring messaging, avoid causing panic. Assemble subcommittee. (Gabe)
- Schedule follow-up meeting to brainstorm possible theories (Gabe)

A significant fraction of attendees also privately recorded the following action item:

- Grant proposal

The astrology community was substantially larger and more organized.
