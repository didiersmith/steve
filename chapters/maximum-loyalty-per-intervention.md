## 0. Maximum Loyalty Per Intervention

Steve spent a week shaving every unnecessary piece of code off the VR interface he could find. It wasn't enough. He and Gabe were still far short of the credits necessary to execute the plan. Together, they humbly approached the one contestant with credits to spare.

Allen nearly laughed them out of his office.

"Let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly", he snorted. "You two idiots are on the cusp of bankruptcy. Your plan is to perform a last-ditch intervention to unify your tribes and undermine my meme - the most successful meme ever to grace this sim - and you want me to fund it?"

"Your meme is on the verge of collapse anyway", snapped Steve. "You're stretched too thin. Your yields are decelerating. People bought into your stupid incestuous gods when things were improving, but now they're just paying lip service."

Allen stopped laughing and gave Steve a withering glare. He probably wasn't used to being spoken to that way.

"What do you propose?" Allen asked.

Steve launched into his pitch. "Maurice Allen. You're a businessman, right?"

"Cut the crap, Steve."

Steve cut the crap. "Shares. We'll give you ten percent of all credits we earn off this meme in exchange for your investment."

"And what size investment would that be?"

Steve named his number.

Allen burst out laughing again. "You realize what kind of valuation you've given yourself? To have any hope of generating ROI, this would have not only have to kill my cash cow, but also become the most successful meme in all of StevieNix history!"

Steve sighed. Gabe looked at his shoes. Allen clicked his pen.

"Does that ten percent come with voting rights?" Allen asked.

"No," responded Steve.

Allen clicked his pen a few more times.

"I want eighty percent."

Eighty percent! What the hell?

"Absolutely not," Steve responded.

"Your other option is bankruptcy", Allen said.

"Our other option," Steve fired back coldly, "is sabotage."

The hundred thousand year old steely-eyed tycoon across the table leaned forwards and rested on his elbows. "Eternal Spring", he enunciated slowly and clearly, "is extremely proud of our commitment to quality. You can live for as long as you like, secure in your knowledge that our vitamins are six nines reliable. That's ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent reliable. Do you have any idea how hard that is to achieve?"

Steve and Gabe sat in silence, unsure of how to respond or where Allen was going with this.

"Of course", Allen continued, "there is still that point zero zero zero one percent." He looked at Steve pointedly, then shifted his glare over to Gabe, and finally back to Steve.

Steve felt stupid. In retrospect, attempting to hardball the man responsible for keeping him alive was a very bad idea.

"We'll settle for forty percent", piped in Gabe, unprompted and without authorization.

"Sixty-five", responded Allen plainly. "That's my final offer. Take it, or get the hell out of my office."

Within a couple of hours, a contract had been signed and the credits had been transferred. Steve and Gabe had been humiliated, but were back in the game.

Intervention time. This was the big one. Steve sparked a couple of memes to prophesize his arrival, donned his VR headset, and dove in. Gosh, things had changed since the reptile days.

He was in some sort of city. The apes had constructed buildings out of...rocks? He walked up to one of them and inspected it. Yup, rocks. They'd piled them up on top of each other and glued them together with something that looked like mud.

He reached out and scratched at the mortar between a couple of rocks. It actually was mud! Holy hell. Steve resolved to spend most of his time outside.

He needed a friend. Staying as far away from the buildings as possible, he walked down the middle of the road towards the river where his most recent prophet liked to hang out. The ape was standing in the river, dunking another ape's head in the water. It looked consensual.

Steve waited until the ape had released his drenched associate. "Hey John!" he yelled from the shore. "It's me!"

Embodying a meme was hard work. Steve spent sixteen hours a day jacked into VR. Everyone wanted miracles.

"Please, God!" someone complained. "We're hungry!"

Steve conjured them some food.

"Please, God! My mom is sick!"

Steve healed the ape's mother.

"Please, God! We're out of booze!"

Okay, this was getting ridiculous.

"You've gotta rein it in," Gabe told him during one of his bathroom breaks. "You're burning through these credits like a student when the loan cheque comes in."

"What's our runway?"

"Just under a week."

Steve did some quick math. Crap. At the current speed, that was less than three years in sim.

"Okay," he said. "I'll focus."

More time preaching, less time intervening. He still healed, though. Healing was overpowered - the loyalty per credit dwarfed every other intervention by such a margin, it was basically in a class of its own. It turned out, apes really hated being sick or crippled. Maybe he'd get Gabe to mangle a few of them so he could heal them later, heh.

"Thank you, God!" wept a female ape whom he'd just cleared of a nasty bacterial infection. "What can I do to repay you?"

"You don't have to do anything," he said. "You just have to believe in me, love me, and get everyone you know to love me too. Then you can have eternal life."

The ape looked confused. "What, you don't want me to sacrifice something?"

Steve blinked. "No, I'm good. Just believe in-"

"Not even a duck?"

"No, I-"

"I can get you a duck."

What kind of insane ideas had the other Gods been implanting?

"No ducks!" he said. "Just spread the word. Love me like a family member, and you get eternal life."

She gave him a skeptical look, bowed her head, and sauntered back to the village - hopefully to spread the word, and not sacrifice any animals. He'd avoided specifying what "eternal life" looked like. Would she guess "packed onto an interstellar warship with enough materiel to destroy a solar system?"

The week passed quickly. By the end of it, his credits were spent, his eyes were bloodshot, and his feet ached from standing all day. Time to wrap it up. He'd amassed a decent number of followers, but how could he make it stick? How could he ensure that his followers dedicated their lives to spreading his meme, and raised their children to do the same?

He remembered the lady who'd wanted to sacrifice the duck, and an idea struck him. What if _he_ were the duck?

Whoa.

Getting himself executed was shockingly easy. He basically just had to show his face in the wrong part of town and before he knew it, Allen's apes had grabbed his avatar and nailed it to a bit of wood. Completely mental, the lot of them.

Steve jacked out of VR and watched his avatar die. Ouch. His followers seemed distraught. Time for the plot twist.

He waited a few minutes, and jacked back in.

Now _that_ made an impression.
