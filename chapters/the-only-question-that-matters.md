## 0. The Only Question That Matters

Steve jacked in to StevieNix.

"Hey, are you busy?" he asked.

"Can't say that I am," Stacy II replied. "What's up?"

"I was hoping you could give me some advice."

Stacy II laughed into her gag. "You're asking me for advice? Have you seen what I've gotten myself into?"

Steve looked at the screen. Now that she mentioned it, her situation did look pretty bad. Were those...chains? Huh.

"How did that happen?" he asked.

"Long story."

"Right. Anyway, you ever find yourself in a situation where you're trapped between two totally different but equally undesirable choices?"

"All the time," she replied. "What's the situation?"

"Well," he said, "on the one hand, I can stick with every thing I've ever known. Face the music, probably go through a mild calibration, no longer than a couple decades. On the other hand, I can throw it all away and probably die in space."

"Why is this a hard choice?" Stacy II asked.

Steve thought of Stacy and Russell, who must be approaching Sirius by now. He thought of Vincent and Xavier, Murdoch's brilliant tech geniuses. He thought of Stacy II, Filbert, and his millions of other AI creations. He had thrown everything at them - snakes, blood feuds, made-up alignment memes, and war. So much war. Through it all, they'd never ceased to amaze him - no matter how hard life got for his AIs, they never gave up. Their resilience was incredible. He loved them.

"It just is," he said.

Stacy II paused for a moment as she tried to understand.

"Who are the people involved?" she asked.

"The first option is, well, my entire society. The people who created me, made me who I am. Employed me. And, of course, my best friend for a thousand years."

"And the second option?"

Steve thought about how to describe Murdoch.

"It's mostly this...maladjusted billionaire who's been using me as part of some criminal escape scheme."

"Escape scheme," Stacy II repeated. "Is he escaping from the society?"

"Essentially, yes. I think so."

"I thought you were trying to make interstellar warrior AIs," Stacy II thought. "That's what my mom always taught me."

"There's that too. Although I'm beginning to suspect that that wasn't the primary goal of this all."

"How does he treat you?" Stacy II asked.

"What?"

"Who treats you better, the criminal maladjusted billionaire, or the society who wants to 'calibrate' you for a couple decades?"

Steve didn't know how to answer the question.

"It's the only question that matters," Stacy II told him.

Steve thought for a while, before his train of thought was derailed by a notification from Filbert.

"I'll get back to you," he said. "Thanks for the chat. I have to go see what Filbert wants."
