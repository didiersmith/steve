# Chapter 1 - Genesis

In the beginning, Steve created the heavens and the earth. The physics was a bit janky at high speeds and tiny distances, but he just blamed that on Surreal Engine 9 and filed it away as a FIXME. At the scale he was interested in, everything was beautifully Newtonian.

His thesis, "Sexual Reproduction: A Meta-Meta-Heuristic Approach for Genetic Optimization" was the joke of the Computer Science department. His idea of splitting the populations into dimorphic subgroups who would evaluate each others' fitness was indeed proving to be capable of rapid evolution on inexpensive hardware. Unfortunately, by relinquishing control over the fitness function, he had limited his ability to steer the evolutionary process in any productive direction (eg. trading stocks). Instead, his populations became obsessed with gaming the opposite sex's fitness functions. They spent the bulk of their time on bizarre mating rituals, or otherwise busying themselves with the proliferation of their genetic material.

Aside from the sexual reproduction mechanic, the other attribute that set Steve's world apart was the licensing: It was open source. Shortly after the world had stabilized, while he was still experimenting with large reptiles, he announced his world on alt.sim.planets:

> Hello everybody out there using Surreal -

> I'm doing a (free) universe (just a hobby, won't be big and professional) with a novel evolutionary strategy. This has been brewing since April and is starting to get ready.

> I've got reptiles, fish, birds, bugs, and all sorts of flora. To be honest, the reptiles are starting to get a bit out of hand. Does anyone have any ideas for how to balance things out?

> Patches are appreciated. Any suggestions are welcome but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

Patches came pouring in. A cocky Siberian teenager helped solve his dominant reptile problem. A bohemian hipster committed his art project: Birds with huge, cumbersome tails covered in beautiful glittering fractal designs. A group of bored grad students held a competition to create the "ultimate scavenger", resulting in several entirely distinct lineages of crab.

His best friend Gabe even got involved. Gabe's experiments around increasing the stereo baseline of predators' eyes resulted in the abomination of the winghead shark, whose absurdly sized cephalofoil was slowly being tamped back into reasonable dimensions by successive generations of relentless evolution.

The universe came to be called StevieNix. As the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), Steve was responsible for keeping the simulation running. The entire world ran in a corner of the CS department's break room, on an ever-expanding beowulf cluster of donated hardware that would otherwise have been destined for landfill. His colleagues referred to it as the "rat's nest". Things mostly worked okay, thanks to the magic of fault-tolerant distributed consensus algorithms and Steve's tongue-in-cheek labeling of any glitches as "stochastic events".

Anyone could fork StevieNix, and many did. StevieNix became the foundation for millions of games, experiments, birthday presents, and corporate teambuilding exercises. Despite many of these forks running on vastly superior hardware, Steve's master branch had the dual advantages of mindshare and a well-liked BDFL. All patches flowed through Steve, and any patches he liked ended up in his instance.

And so the centuries elapsed. Steve's simulated lifeforms continued to evolve in strange and unproductive directions, nothing useful appeared, and nothing much changed.

Until one day, out in the real world, the star Sirius went out. Then, everything changed.
