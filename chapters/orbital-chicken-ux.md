## 0. Orbital Chicken UX

The freezing cold ocean spray flew over the side of their small boat and drenched Stacy through her clothes and to her robotic skin. Praying that her monkeybot was waterproof, she retreated back into the cabin and shut the door.

"Last time I was on a boat with you, we almost died," she remarked to Russell.

"And look at us now," he smiled back. Then, his face dropped a little as he remembered the stakes. "Of course," he added, "if we die this time, it's actually for real."

Stacy tried not to think about his comment. Stumbling forward, she grabbed a handrail for balance as the boat crested a wave and came crashing down into the trough.

"Remind me why we can't just launch from land again?" she asked Russell.

"Murdoch was pretty evasive when I asked," he replied. "I suspect that FEDSEC hasn't been made fully aware of the purpose of the orbital ring. They think it's an interstellar radio or something."

Stacy nodded. If she had learned anything about the Federal Department of Social Emotional Calibration, it was that they were best kept in the dark.

"Well, you'd think they'd have given us a bigger boat," she grumbled.

"Too visible," he shrugged. "Just be grateful we have a cabin this time."

Stacy groaned, laid down on the floor, and shut her eyes. She was pretty sure her monkeybot couldn't vomit, but it sure felt like it wanted to.

She was woken by Vincent's voice crackling over the radio. "Approaching the launchpad!" he announced.

She clambered to her feet and made her way to join Russell at the front of the cabin. "See it?" she asked, staring out into the blackness beyond.

"Nothing," he responded.

She pressed her face to the glass, trying to make out any shapes in the dark, moonless night. She might as well have been blindfolded.

Without warning, the boat thudded and came to a sudden stop. Her face smacked against the window. It hurt, just like a real face would have.

"You have arrived at your destination," Vincent announced.

"Couldn't have brought it in more smoothly?" Russell asked, picking himself off the floor.

"Be thankful you got there," Vincent muttered. "I'd like to see you navigate here without GPS."

Stacy stayed out of the argument. Navigating to a raft in the middle of the ocean was one thing. Navigating to a vanished star in the outer reaches of the galaxy was a whole other challenge.

She opened the cabin door and stepped out with Russell onto the deck. As her eyes adjusted to the low light, she made out her home for the next three months - a house-sized black cylinder lying on its side, above which loomed an enormous balloon.

Russell pointed at one end of the cylinder. "Fusion rockets," he explained. Then, panning over to the other end of the cylinder, he said "living quarters."

Picking up his bag, he walked towards the living quarters. Stacy nodded to no one in particular, and followed.

"What do you mean, I have to accelerate it? I need to slow the shuttle down to drop the tether," crackled Vincent's annoyed voice on the radio.

"It's relative, remember?" replied an exasperated Xavier. "To slow down relative to you, the shuttle needs to speed up relative to the ring."

"This is terrible UX," Vincent grumbled.

"You do realize that the orbital ring is spinning, right? It's in the name. It orbits."

"Who designed this interface? Don't tell me you did it."

"Come on, dad. It's not that bad."

"A chicken could have done a better job."

"Dad-"

"I'm serious. Next time you need to make a user interface, just grab a chicken and scatter some grain on a keyboard. It'll produce a more usable design."

The father/son duo had been bickering on the shared line for ten minutes. Stacy drummed her fingers nervously and glanced at Russell, who responded with a look that said "man, I really hope these idiots figure this out." Stacy reflected for a moment on the expressive realism of his monkeybot's prosthetic face, before turning her attention to the window. She could just make out the ocean, kilometers below the high altitude to which they'd risen with the balloon.

The faintest rays of sunshine were just starting to light up the sky. If Vincent and Xavier didn't get the launch mechanism figured out in the next few minutes, they'd lose the cover of darkness - and with it, any remaining pretense that the orbital ring was an interstellar radio antenna. FEDSEC would begin raids almost immediately. She could imagine them confiscating all electronic devices, which would imply the powering down of StevieNix and the death of everyone she loved. If Steve had thought to install sweat glands, her palms would be drenched right now.

Her wandering mind was snapped into the present by Vincent's excited voice. "Finally! Prepare for launch!" he announced.

She sighed in relief and looked again at Russell, who was tightening his straps on his five-point harness. She did the same while craning her neck upwards, trying to spot the descending tether in the dim morning light. All she could see was the enormous black balloon above them.

The spaceship clunked. "Tether attached," Vincent announced. "Now, let me guess - to take off, I have to decelerate the shuttle?"

"Correct," Xavier responded. "Because the ring is spinning."

Stacy could sense Vincent's paternalistic, teasing smile over the crackle of the radio. "Seriously, get a chicken" he replied. "It'll help. Anyway, hold on tight!"

The balloon released the ship, and Stacy let out an involuntary yelp as the support of her chair disappeared and the entire cabin entered a sickening freefall. A moment later, she was slammed back into her chair in a violent jerk as the tether taughtened. Kilometers above them, attached to the orbital ring, the shuttle started accelerating - or decelerating, or whatever.

"Oof," groaned Russell. "This sucks."

Stacy struggled to reply. Once again praying that her monkeybot didn't have the ability to puke, she closed her eyes and gripped her armrests. Bracing against the enormous g-forces, she and Russell hung on for dear life as the craft was yanked up through the atmosphere and flung out into space.
