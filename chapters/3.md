Trounced by a bunch of zodiac enthusiasts. What an embarrasment. There weren't enough hens in the world to lay the cumulative quantity of egg on the astronomers' faces.

While their primitive ancestors had once gazed upon the stars and seen the final frontier, an infinite array of worlds ripe for the raping and pillaging, modern enlightened folk had no interest in conquest.

The field of astronomy, like the rest of academia, had slowly ossified into an elaborate economy of prestige. The occasional student unfortunate enough to enter the field spent several years taking "classes" under a rotating cast of more senior academics, during which he learned the basic art of memorizing accepted ideas and paraphrasing them in sufficiently novel ways so as to avoid triggering anti-plagiarism software. A successful student was one who flattered, but never out-shone his academic superiors.

After the years of classes, should the student wish to continue his academic career, he would seek an academic supervisor.
