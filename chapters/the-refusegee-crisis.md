## 0. The Refusegee Crisis

Everybody produces sewage. In a modern society, few ever think about it, and most have very little understanding about how it is managed. The People's Republic was so modern that not a single person ever spent any amount of time thinking about sewage. There were no plumbers or wastewater treatment workers in the PR - all the work was done by robots.

The most important detail to know about sewage is that it flows downhill. All sewage systems are designed as networks of slightly downhill-sloping pipes. This usually works quite well, except when there is no feasible downhill path between a house and a sewage treatment plant. Then, the sewage must be made to flow uphill. 

This is accomplished by a "lift station." A lift station is composed of a well, a number of pumps (typically two), and a set of floats. Incoming sewage is collected in the well. The floats detect the amount of sewage that has amassed. When the level of the sewage gets high enough, a pump is activated and the sewage is pumped uphill. From its newly elevated position, the sewage can resume its ordinary downhill trajectory.

If a lift station fails, disaster follows. Before long, the well is filled and the sewage has nowhere to go. It starts to back up out of the lowest points it can find - bringing with it fecal-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis A.

People often credit medical innovations with the dramatic increase in life expectancy seen in the twentieth century. Aside from antibiotics, this is inaccurate. The real heroes of the twentieth century, were the engineers who built the sewage systems.

Lift stations in the Old World were monitored and maintained by unsung workers on a meticulous schedule. But not in the People's Republic. The PR was, after all, built by Russell - a programmer with an omniscient supercomputer.

Why would you implement a failure-prone system of floats to detect the level of sewage in a lift station, when your omniscient computer already knows the level to nanoscale precision? Why dispatch humans to check up on the system when the MHI-10 already knows the amount of wear and tear on every component? Why design the system to be human-maintainable at all, when you have a fleet of trillions of tiny robots, who can navigate the pipes and fix any issue before anyone has noticed?

For two full decades, the sewage system in the PR worked flawlessly. Effluent was effortlessly discarded, and it was so far from peopleâ€™s minds that no one even thought that someone else should think about it. It was so perfect that it was invisible.

Until the MHI-10 was disconnected. Then, it was all anyone could think about. Hell, as it turns out, is other people's fecal matter backing up through your shower drain.

Sullivan woke up to the sound of his wife screaming.

Why did it smell like poop?

Bleary-eyed, he stumbled downstairs to investigate. The problem was immediately apparent. The bottom floor of their house had been turned into a septic tank.

They climbed out through an upstairs window. Once outside, it soon became clear that the plumbing issue was not localized to their house.

It was mayhem.

Within hours, vast sections of the PR had been declared uninhabitable. Sullivan, his family, and everyone else in their neighbourhood fled the unbearable stench by trekking to higher ground. Civil society broke down - shops were looted, fights broke out, and the inhabitants of every high-ground neighbourhood they encountered had organized into a local militia specifically to keep them out.

Problems require solutions, and Sullivan was a man of solutions. One particular solution, in fact: Legislation. 

Sullivan drafted the "Help Refugees in Crisis Act." It made it illegal to refuse shelter to anyone fleeing a crisis. It also made it illegal to infringe on another's "right to food and basic necessities," which made it illegal to prevent the looting of stores, warehouses, and even private pantries. For good measure, the act also imposed price caps.

The police were dispatched. The neighbourhood defence militias were disbanded, and private security forces were prevented from defending grocery and department stores.

Sullivan and his family moved in to the living room of a house on a hilltop, whose primary inhabitants clearly resented their presence.

Within a few days, People's Republican society was unrecognizable. The lowlands that comprised the bulk of the PR had been completely sacrificed, the lowermost houses having been converted by gravity and pressure into above-ground septic tanks. Eighty percent of the population had been displaced, crowding into the spare rooms, living rooms, kitchens and hallways of those fortunate enough to live at elevation. Every shop, restaurant, and depot had been raided completely empty of food, with importers refusing to import any more until they were made whole for the goods they had lost.

To Sullivan's pride, the Executive Branch stepped in. A Food Task Force was assembled, which purchased vast quantities of wheat, corn, and soy on the global commodities markets. The military was mobilized to distribute the rations. Overnight, the official entirety of the People's Republican diet became unleavened bread, grits, and tofu.

The primary inhabitants of Sullivan's new house refused to eat tofu. He walked in to the kitchen one day while the wife was cooking chicken. Using his masterful techniques of subtle interrogation, he prized the truth out of her criminal mouth: A black market had emerged for illicitly imported ingredients, peddled by people with the means and willingness to collect eye-watering prices for their goods in direct contravention of the Help Refugees in Crisis Act. 
Sullivan had the entire family imprisoned. He and his family moved out of the living room and in to the bedrooms.

The Military Corps of Engineers was tasked with finding a solution to the sewage problem. Their conclusion was less than optimistic: There was no way to modify the old sewage system; it was cast into the polymerized fullerene foundations of the island itself. Without nanoscale tech, the easiest way to reclaim the lowlands was to build an entirely new, above-ground sewage system. One in every five buildings would have to sacrificed and converted into lift stations, pumping sewage out of their drains and up the necessary inclines. It would take months and the result would be unreliable, unsanitary, and an aesthetic disaster.

Their report was immediately classified. The Executive Branch was optimistic that tensions would ease as the population adapted to their new circumstances. Unfortunately, this did not play out as planned. The population divided into the "Highlanders" - the original occupants of the elevated regions - and the "Lowlanders" - alternatively termed the "Poo People", "Refusegees", and other, less charitable monikers.

Sullivan did not like being referred to as a "Poo Person," a "Refusegee," or other, less charitable monikers. Sullivan was a hero. He, more than anyone else, had Helped Refugees in Crisis. He had drafted the legislation.

After a few weeks of strained but stable relationships, a dispute between a Highlander and a family of Lowlanders living in his bathroom turned violent. The Highlander was killed. His death became the flashpoint that ignited the explosive animosity between the two groups. 

Before long, buildings were on fire and bodies were hanging from streetlamps. The Executive Branch had to intervene.

Sullivan had the solution: Legislation.

He drafted the Emergency Powers Act, which granted the Executive Branch the ability to suspend all existing laws in the face of civil unrest. It easily passed referendum. Unburdened by the necessity of pussyfooting through the quagmire of restraints built up over decades of ad hoc legislation, the Executive Branch set about solving the problem.

The problem, evidently, was that the Highlanders were too attached to their homes. While their feelings were understandable, they were clearly neither sustainable nor conducive to peaceful integration between the two groups. The solution was obvious: To displace the Highlanders as well.

Sullivan smiled as the Executive Branch nationalized all homes. Residents were reassigned to homes on the basis of an inscrutable algorithm, that mostly took into account the residents' professions. The highest altitude homes went to well-behaved civil servants. The military stepped up to ensure that the Great Reshuffling was completed with minimal protest. Sullivan and his family moved in to a manor.

While this solved the problem from Sullivan's perspective, conditions in the lowest habitable regions were extremely cramped. The Executive Branch erected billboards, targeting disaffected young men with a simple message: "If you don't like it, join the navy." Wishing to escape the squalor, many did. Still, it did little to ease the conditions. Something else had to be done.

When Sullivan went to work one day, his boss sat his entire team down for a meeting.

"You're all being reassigned," he announced. "Gold's on the backburner. If we don't fix this housing issue, pronto, these animals are going to eat us alive."

They were given wide latitude to find solutions. Most of his team explored techniques to influence their newly-installed puppet government of the Theocratic Dominion into accepting refugees.

Sullivan found this approach to be crude. Boring, even. He considered legislating more houses instead. Before he could start drafting, the voice in his head stepped in and encouraged him to explore a different alternative.

"They still have nanoscale tech in The Anarchy," said the voice.

Interesting.

Sullivan logged on to the Dark Web, where the Anarchists liked to hang out. The voice was right. Not only did the Anarchists have nanoscale tech, but they'd used it to build a flying island.

The Military Corps of Engineers had assumed no nanoscale tech. If the People's Republic could get the tech back, they could fix the old sewage system.

They could also do a whole lot more.

With a combination of nanoscale manufacturing and the right legislation, the People's Republic could rule the world.

In deep consultation with the voice in his head, Sullivan came up with a plan.
