## 0. Reverse Prometheus

Russell studied his fingernails. It still weirded him out that he never need to cut them.

His robotic body was a marvel of engineering. It was at once familiar, and unfamiliar. Moving it felt perfectly natural, and the pattern of veins and tendons on the back were the same as they'd ever been. The loose skin and wrinkles that had started to appear with age, however, were gone. His entire body, in fact, moved with an ease that he hadn't experienced in a long time - perhaps since his early twenties, back in Perth.

Being dead wasn't so bad.

He still wasn't entirely sure what Murdoch wanted them to do. So far, his job seemed to mainly consist of re-learning physics and motivating Xavier. Poor kid was probably going crazy with the amount of divine input into his internal monologue. Ah well.

Outside of work, Russell spent his abundant free time chatting with Steve, learning as much as he could about their world. Last week, he'd asked Steve if he ever wanted children. He'd been treated to a long explanation of the licensing process, followed by the genetic engineering, and finally the years of close surveillance after the baby had been produced and delivered by the appropriate government department (something called FEDSEC). Steve was unenthusiastic about the prospect. Russell had been left with many more questions than he'd started with, and was still trying to process his newfound knowledge.

The others excitedly chattered, and Russell looked up at the screen. Xavier was in some sort of plane he'd built, that was meant to fly in space. Murdoch and Steve had joined them in the office for the occasion.

"You can do it, lad!" Murdoch said into the microphone. "The design is perfect. Nothing could possibly go wrong!"

"The design is perfect," Xavier's internal monologue echoed out through the computer speakers. "Nothing could possibly go wrong."

Russell around the room. Steve was pacing, trying to avoid looking at the screen. Vincent and Stacy were both sitting a little farther back than Murdoch, chewing their indestructible fingernails.

It was a tense moment.

He watched on the screen as a tether descended down through the atmosphere and attached itself to Xavier's space-plane. This design was absolutely bonkers. Vincent's son and his team of Anarchists had somehow managed to build a solid carbon ring that orbited the Earth, and were now about to use it to fling the kid into space. If he were a betting man, he'd place a small fortune on Xavier's plane being torn apart and Xavier becoming a new soul in that asshole's Allen's collection.

Still, he couldn't look away. Xavier said something into his radio and back on Earth, someone clicked a button on some computer. A shuttle began to move on the ring, and Xavier's plane was yanked up through the atmosphere.

Russell found himself biting his fingernails as well. He expected the space-plane to blow apart any second, but it held. The kid seemed pretty uncomfortable as he was ripped at heavy acceleration through the stratosphere, but it looked like he would live. It probably wasn't as bad as it seemed - they always watched StevieNix on fast forward.

Within a couple of minutes, the kid was still attached to the tether, being ripped around the Earth at escape velocity. He said something into his radio, and the tether released. The plane was released, like a rock from a sling, at a speed fast enough to reach Jupiter in a year.

Vincent nudged past Murdoch and grabbed the mic. "How do you feel?" he asked.

"Yeah, pretty good," Xavier replied. "This is wild."

Russell watched as Xavier pushed a couple of buttons, and a fusion rocket ignited on the back of his plane. He felt a pang of jealousy as the kid manipulated the controls of the space-plane and guided it back to Earth. Damn, that looked fun.

Satisfied, Murdoch swiveled around and pointed his thumb over his shoulder back at the screen.

"That," he said. "That's what I want."

Russell nodded. Finally, the assignment was clear.

"I don't understand," Stacy said. "Why can't we just copy his space stuff up here?"

Steve looked at Russell to provide an explanation. Russell sighed. Murdoch had left them to go buy more cigarettes, and Steve seemed weirdly reluctant to have anything to do with this project. That left him as the next best person to explain.

"Xavier can build orbital rings and space-planes because he has nanoscale manufacturing," he explained.

"Following," Stacy said. "The ASIC thing you guys are always going on about."

"Yes. He has the ASIC because he bootstrapped it with an omniscient supercomputer."

"Yup."

"And we don't have an omniscient supercomputer."

"Why can't we just copy the ASIC?" she asked.

Russell shook his head. "The physics is too different. It relies on quantum effects."

"So we need to make an ASIC with our physics, without using an omniscient supercomputer?"

"Yup."

"How hard could that be?"

Russell laughed. She truly had no idea.

"Why can't Xavier make it for us?" Stacy asked. "He can make anything."

"We'd have to switch StevieNix to run on a completely different physics engine," Russell said. "God only knows what that would break."

"God has no idea what that would break," Steve interjected.

Russell, Stacy and Vincent swiveled around to face their creator.

"It's a pretty complicated universe," Steve explained. "And even if we got it to work, I couldn't even begin to imagine the computational requirements."

Vincent finally spoke up. "You mentioned budgetary reasons before."

Steve nodded. "StevieNix has all sorts of optimizations. Light speed. Wave/particle duality. If we had to simulate every particle perfectly, we'd need to seriously increase the size of our datacenter. Trust me, I've tried."

Russell was surprised. "You have a realistic physics engine?" he asked.

"Sure!" Steve replied. "I wrote one a few centuries ago. That's how I know how expensive it is."

Russell looked back towards the screen, and mulled over a thought.

"Xavier can go to space," he said. "What if we just cordon off a little bit of space and make that run your realistic physics engine? Then he can fly in and out and bootstrap a new ASIC that way."

Steve opened his mouth as if to object, but nothing came out.

Eventually, he spoke. "Yeah, that might actually work," he said.

The three monkeybots stared at him silently, waiting for more details.

"We'll have to reassign most of the StevieNix cluster to run the cube," he said. "The sim will slow to a crawl. The alignment team will be pissed. But yeah, that might work."

Vincent leaned back and smiled. "Like a reverse Prometheus," he said. "Stealing fire from my son to give it to the Gods."
