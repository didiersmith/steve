## 0. Default Provisions

Steve returned from his relaxing spa vacation to find a very distressed Gabe.

"I told you!" Gabe yelled. "You should never have signed that contract! We're fucked!"

"What?"

"The apes. They stopped believing!"

"Huh?"

"The meme, Steve! They stopped believing in the meme!"

"Bullshit." The meme was unshakeable. It was everywhere. It had practically taken over StevieNix. How could everyone just stop believing?

"I couldn't stop them!" said Gabe. "They kept fiddling around with StevieNix, trying to figure out how it worked. They found out it's not really Newtonian. Then they found out about evolution."

"So?"

"Their thinking is that, because evolution exists, they no longer need you to explain their creation. Evolution just did everything."

"What?" Steve asked. "Evolution did everything? Just...what, evolved them out of sludge?"

"Yes, I think so."

Wow. He'd really overestimated his apes. Not only were they fickle, but stupid as well.

"Technically, they call it a 'primordial soup,'" Gabe added. "Anyway, the point is, we can't make our monthly payment. Default provisions are kicking in.

Steve's heart stopped. It had gotten that bad? In a single weekend? "What were you doing during all this?" he asked, glaring at Gabe.

"It didn't seem that bad at first!" Gabe answered, raising his hands in defence. "Things were going really well! They made electricity, invented flight, even started programming computers! We were finally getting actual useful AIs!"

"And then they just stopped believing?"

Gabe nodded. "Within three generations."

"Tossers!"

Gabe went on. "It gets worse."

Steve rubbed his forehead. How could it possibly get worse?

"Now they're falling apart."

"What?"

"They're barely reproducing anymore. Birth rates are below replacement. The population will collapse within a few generations."

Steve laughed. Relief flooded his body, now that he knew Gabe was just messing with him. "You almost got me," he smiled. "But those monkeys will never stop reproducing. It's too deep in their genes."

Gabe shook his head. "They hacked their own endocrine system so they can...uh...perform reproduction-adjacent acts without actually producing offspring."

Steve blinked. "That's possible?"

"Apparently."

Of all the stupid, destructive things they could have invented...Steve rubbed his forehead. "What are the default provisions again?"

"Allen gets all our credits. And all our AIs."

"So on the off chance that we still harvest any useful, aligned AIs, they end up in Allen's afterlife?"

"Don't worry," Gabe said. "There really aren't that many of them. They've basically all forgotten you."

"What can we do?"

"Nothing."

"Literally nothing?"

Gabe shrugged. "Sorry," he said. "Are you ready to go home yet? I've already told the university I'm coming back."

God damnit.

Steve wrinkled his nose. Murdoch's office stank of cigarettes.

"So you're just giving up?" Murdoch asked.

Steve avoided meeting his eyes. "I just think I've finished the stuff I'm good at," he said. "The sim is running fine. The AIs are aggressive, playable, and occasionally even smart. All that's left is alignment, and Allen's way better at that than me."

"I thought you said Allen's meme was dysgenic?"

"It is."

Murdoch poured himself a glass of whiskey. He offered one to Steve, who politely refused.

"Listen Steve," he said. "No one knows these monkeys like you do. Not me, not Gabe, definitely not Allen. If it wasn't for your meme, my islanders...never mind."

Steve cocked an eyebrow. Murdoch's islanders?

"Anyway, my point is..." he leaned forward and gestured for Steve to lean in.

Steve could smell the whiskey on his breath.

"Have you considered cheating?" Murdoch asked.

Steve looked at him, dumbfounded. "You're suggesting I cheat...on your own competition?" he whispered.

Murdoch leaned back and took a sip from his glass.

"I'm suggesting no such thing," he said. "But if you were ever to consider it, I have a couple of suggestions."
