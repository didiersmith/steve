## 0. Default Provisions

"Bugger!" swore Steve. "Damn and blast!" Default provisions were never supposed to be triggered. "What the hell happened?"

"It was the islanders," explained Gabe. "They kept fiddling around with StevieNix, trying to figure out how it worked. They found out it's not really Newtonian. Then they found out about evolution."

"So?"

"I think their thinking is that, because evolution exists, they no longer need you to explain their creation. Evolution just did everything."

"Evolution did everything? From what, sludge?"

"Yes, I think so."

Steve swore again and threw his screwdriver into a corner of the datacenter.

"I think, technically, they call it a 'primordial soup'," Gabe added, trying to be helpful.

"Soup! They think they evolved out of soup! I knew they were kinda stupid, but soup?! What, there was a big bowl of soup and then all of a sudden, self-replicating genetic machines composed of thousands of atoms?"

"To be fair, they think it took a while."

"Idiots!" Steve looked for more inexpensive durable objects to fling around the datacenter, but failing to find any, thumped his desk instead. "Absolute wankers!" Then, he fixed his glare on Gabe. "What were you doing during all this?"

"It didn't seem that bad at first!" Gabe answered, defensively. "Things were going really well. They figured out how to use mass-energy equivalence to produce bombs and generate electricity. Oh, and they invented flight and transistor-based computers! They even made chemical space rockets and remote-control drones that could kill other apes. We were finally getting actual useful AIs. Another hundred years or so and they'd have caught up to our technology."

"And they just stopped believing?"

Gabe nodded. "Within three generations."

"Tossers!"

Gabe went on. "It gets worse. Now they're falling apart."

"What?"

"They're barely reproducing anymore. Birth rates are below replacement. The population will collapse within a few generations."

Steve laughed. "OK, now I know you're messing with me. Those monkeys will never stop reproducing. It's too deep in their genes."

"They hacked their own endocrine system so they can...uh...perform reproduction-adjacent acts without actually producing offspring."

Steve blinked. "That's possible?"

"Yes, they really went hard on the tinkering."

"But I thought they loved their offspring?"

"Only after they're born. It turns out that, until then, they just really love the act of mating."

Steve rubbed his forehead. "What are the default provisions again?"

"Allen gets to purchase all of our newly aligned souls for pennies on the credit until we make up for any missed payments."

"So on the off chance that we still harvest any useful, technologically capable, aligned AIs, they end up in Allen's afterlife?"

"Don't worry," reassured Gabe, "there really aren't that many of them."

"And he's getting 100% of our credits?"

Gabe nodded.

"So there's literally nothing we can do?"

Gabe shifted his weight and glanced around. "There's always something we can do, Steve. You run StevieNix."

"What do you mean?"

Gabe gestured at the disassembled blade server on Steve's desk. "We can cheat."
