## 0. Space, Idiot!

Steve's office door burst open and Murdoch changed in.

"Steve! There you are!" he gasped.

Steve looked at the disheveled tycoon struggle to catch his breath. "What's up, Murdoch?" he asked.

Murdoch recovered enough to stand up straight and glare at him. "You need to pack up StevieNix, now."

Steve reeled. "What do you mean, pack it up?" he asked. "It's on a datacenter."

"Goddamn it!" Murdoch yelled. "Pack it up! How much clearer can I get? Unplug the servers. Put them on batteries. Wheel them out onto the tarmac. Let's go!"

"What's going on?" Steve asked.

For a moment, Steve thought he could detect the faintest flicker of worry in Murdoch's face before it was replaced by his customary stern stoicism.

"FEDSEC's onto us," he explained. "I don't know how. Someone must have tipped them off."

He glared at Steve, who held his hands up in protest of his innocence.

"If we don't get out of here in the next couple hours, it will all have been for nothing. We'll all be calibrated. Possibly deleted. At a minimum, I can guarantee that we'll never escape this goddamn hellhole."

"What do you mean, 'out of here?'" Steve asked.

"Space, idiot! Out of this goddamn penitentiary! Vincent's building launch vehicles as we speak. Figure out how the hell to pack up StevieNix and get it out on the tarmac!"

He strode to the office door and walked out. "Now!" he yelled, and slammed the door shut behind him.

Steve stood rooted to the spot, dumb with shock.
