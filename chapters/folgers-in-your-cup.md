## 0. Folgers in Your Cup

Allen was in a weirdly good mood when Steve ran into him at the coffee machine.

"Congratulations on getting out of default, Steve!" he said. "How are you doing?"

"Pretty good, thanks," Steve replied. "And yourself?"

"Never better!" Allen said, raised his mug to Steve, and sauntered away from the kitchenette towards his office.

Steve watched him, confused. Allen had been fairly hostile to him recently. Steve had begun to worry that he'd learned about his sneaky intervention with the MHI-10. But this change of heart...inexplicable. 

As he pondered the situation, Steve realized with a jolt that he'd gotten distracted. At the current sim rate, he'd accidentally left Stacy alone in the diner for...oh, goodness.

For a while.

He jogged back to his office, hurriedly loaded Russell into the diner, and put on his VR headset. When his avatar finally walked in the door, Stacy was seemingly unbothered. Mostly, she was complaining to Russell about the coffee.

"They just have this awful stuff called 'drip,'" she said. "Is it too much to ask for a Long Mac Topped Up?"

They turned to Steve as he walked in.

"Is this heaven?" Russell asked.

"Do you have better coffee?" Stacy added.

"You don't like the coffee?" Steve answered. "It's Folgers!"

Stacy made a face.

"The best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup!" Steve said. "It took me an entire weekend to get the flavour profile right."

"Heaven is supposed to have decent coffee," Stacy grumbled.

"Heaven is what you make of it," Steve replied. "How are you settling in?"

"Great, thanks" answered Russell, who had only been there a couple of minutes.

"Are we here for all eternity?" asked Stacy.

Steve laughed at her joke, then noticed the serious expression on his aligned AI's face.

"Relax," he said. "This is temporary. I just spun you up to berate you for dying! What the hell? I step away for ten minutes and you're dead?"

"I thought you said it was part of the plan!" objected Stacy.

Drat. He had said that.

"Right," he said. "Anyway," he continued after an awkward pause, "things are in a bit of a state. Alignment is dropping like a stone. Your 'Theocratic Dominion'" - he said to Stacy, "cannot function without you."

"My daughter will take it back," Stacy confidently announced.

"Your daughter is...certainly an interesting case study."

"What do you mean by that?"

Steve moved on. "And your state," he said to Russell, "is covered in poop."

"What?"

"Here, I'll show you."

He walked to the bar, picked up a remote, and aimed it at the TV on the wall. The TV turned on and displayed a live, real-time feed of the chaos in the PR.

Russell burst out laughing.

"Serves them right," he said. "Ungrateful assholes. I gave them everything, and they tortured me to death. Drowning in their own filth seems fitting. I honestly couldn't care less."

Steve nodded and handed the remote to Stacy, who examined it curiously. "Fair enough," he said, "but with things secularizing up in the TD and people being...more concerned about their immediate material conditions in the PR, there's a real chance I'm not going to be able to make my next loan payment. Everyone's going out of alignment again."

"Your what?" Stacy asked.

Steve sighed and came clean. He explained the entire situation with Allen, his exorbitant monthly payments, and the default conditions.

"So if we don't get enough people to worship you," Stacy said, "when our kids die, they won't even join us in the afterlife? They'll go to some guy they've never heard of named Allen?"

"Oh trust me," Steve said, "they've heard of him."

"What do they know him as?"

Steve told them, and their eyes widened in shock.

"Frick," Russell said. "That guy sucks."

Although Stacy didn't say anything, Steve could tell she was angry. She put the remote down and silently lowered her glare into her mug of Folgers.

"Anyway," Steve said, breaking the awkward silence. "You two don't need to worry about that. I'm sure your kids will sort it out. Hah!"

Stacy kept her eyes lowered. "So how long are we here for?" she asked.

"Not long," Steve replied. "Murdoch tells me the monkeybots are almost ready."

"The what?"

"We need to wait for Vincent to die, though. For some reason, Murdoch is quite fond of him."

"Who's Murdoch?" Russell asked.

"You'll meet him soon enough. Anyway," Steve said, "I hope you enjoyed your berating. Try the cheeseburgers, they're really quite nice!"

With that, he exited the simulation and took off his VR headset.

Goodness, Stacy was scary when she was upset.
