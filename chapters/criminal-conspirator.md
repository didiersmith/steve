## 0. Criminal Conspirator

Steve was a little disappointed at his colleagues' timidity regarding the monkeybots. As he and Gabe walked with the three embodied AIs down the hall, people scurried into their offices and locked their doors. He even heard a couple of them pushing furniture up against the door as they walked past.

Even Gabe seemed a little uncomfortable. "So, are you declaring mission accomplished?" he asked as they stood together in the lobby of the main research building. "Time to rest on your laurels and come back to your actual job?"

Steve looked at his trio of monkeybots, who were marveling at the drab interior of the office building.

"Now?" he asked. "Now that we're finally getting somewhere?"

"You've gotten somewhere," Gabe replied. "It's done."

Steve bit his lip. "Gabe," he said, "I've gotten more accomplished in the past year at MHI than I did in a thousand years at the uni. Just think what I can do in another six months! At this rate, we may actually be able to build our interstellar army!

Gabe glared at him and made a sharp throat-cutting gesture to remind him of the legality of his proposal.

"A _government-sanctioned_ interstellar army," Steve corrected himself.

"Sorry, Steve," Gabe said. "I didn't realize you were so..._ambitious_."

With that, Gabe bid the group farewell. Steve watched in confusion as his old friend walked out the lobby door and into the sterile familiarity of the world outside of Murdoch Heavy Industries.

They continued their tour of the office park. The next person they ran into was Allen, by the coffee machine. He jumped as he saw the three monkeybots, but quickly composed himself.

"The first monkeybots, eh?" he asked, looking Russel, Stacy and Vincent up and down. "Are you going to kill me?"

The three robots shook their heads.

"Good." Allen studied the robots closer. "I watched you all die," he added eventually.

Steve was getting quite uncomfortable.

Allen walked up to Stacy, and studied her up and down. He reached his hand out, grabbed her jaw, opened her mouth, and looked inside it like he was inspecting a horse.

"Very impressive work," he said.

Stacy scowled as she was released and Steve hurriedly ushered the trio down the hall and into their new open-plan office.

"Who the hell was that dickhead?" Stacy asked when they'd closed the door.

"Oh, that was Allen," Steve said. "Just being his usual self."

"That's Allen?!" Stacy asked. "That's the guy you've promised our kids to if you don't make your payments?"

"Only if they're aligned," Steve corrected her. "Otherwise their minds get used for experiments."

Stacy screamed.

Murdoch didn't seem to be his usual self when he eventually entered the open-plan office. He seemed a little less coordinated than usual, and slurred his words. Steve wondered what he had been doing.

He grinned when he saw the three monkeybots. "My beautiful maniacs," he said. "Welcome to the world!"

He shook their hands one by one, and lingered when he got to Vincent. "My perfect islander," he said, staring at Vincent's face.

Murdoch shook himself out of his daze and clapped his hands together. "How are you settling in?" he asked the group.

"Yeah, fine" Vincent replied.

"Good. You're probably wondering why I brought you here."

Steve had been wondering that as well.

"I'm sure Steve's already filled you in on the whole 'AI alignment competition,'" he started.

The trio nodded.

"All very important stuff," Murdoch continued. "But there's another project of equal, possibly greater importance. It involves your son," he said, nodding to Vincent.

Steve cocked his head slightly. He had mostly ignored Murdoch and the Anarchists. What could the billionaire titan possibly need from Xavier? He didn't have the slightest idea.

But Vincent seemed to know. He nodded his head. "Nanoscale manufacturing," he said.

Murdoch smiled. "Yup. I don't think even Xavier really understands the implications of what he's built." 

Steve reeled. What had Xavier built? What were the implications?

"What has he built?" Stacy asked.

"Oh, nothing," Murdoch replied. "Only the most advanced manufacturing system in either of the known universes. So far, he's used it to build a flying island and to terraform a decent chunk of Ancarctica. But with the proper guidance, he can do way more. He can go to space. And if you three do your jobs correctly", he gestured at Vincent, Stacy and Russell, "we can go to space too."

Steve's heartbeat quickened as he processed this new information. It was one thing to academically debate "calling" versus "knocking", or to conduct AI alignment research in preparation for an imaginary interstellar war that would almost certainly never happen. It was another thing to participate in a realistic plan to violate the most sacred law in society: No one leaves Elba.

He didn't know why space launches were banned. Some historical reason, decided a hundred millenia before his birth. All he knew was that, as of today, his job function had changed - from academic researcher, to criminal conspirator.

He followed the group around wordlessly as Murdoch gave them a tour of the office, introducing them to their computers, the library of physics textbooks, and the coffee machine. The monkeybots had no idea that they were being asked to do something highly illegal. Should he tell them?

What about Xavier and his Anarchists? Should he warn them, as well? Would FEDSEC be lenient on them, considering that they weren't even "real people?"

Should he quit and go back to his old job? But then what would happen to his AIs?

And did he even want to quit?

After Murdoch left, Steve and the three monkeybots sat on the couches. Steve had decided to hold off on telling them about the legal status of space launches. They'd had enough of a whirlwind for one day.

"So, physics is Newtonian here?" Russell asked, flipping through a textbook.

Steve nodded. "That's what you know it as," he said. "Up here, we just call it physics."

"So what's the speed of light?"

"As fast as you can throw it."

"Man," Vincent said, craning his neck to look at the textbook. "That's so weird."

Steve laughed. "Actually, it's your physics that's weird. I drew a lot of flak for it, but compromises had to be made. Budgetary reasons, you understand."

Stacy, who had been silent for some time, lost her cool.

"I don't care about physics!" she shouted. "What are you doing to do about my kids, Steve? Have you forgotten about them already? How are you going to keep them away from that creep?"

Steve recoiled. He wasn't used to being addressed so...passionately. At least, she had provided him with an excuse to distance himself from the criminal conspiracy.

"Right!" he said. "I was just going to get back to that."

"You'd better!" Stacy said.

With that, Steve bade the trio farewell and practically ran out of the open-plan office, back to his familiar desk and the soothing comfort of plausible deniability.
