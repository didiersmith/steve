## 0. Lean Operation

A few weeks later, Stacy II practically skipped from the office to her scheduled downtown rendezvous with Sullivan and Filbert. They had rented a private office in a co-working space in the city for this purpose.

"I did it!" she announced, bursting into the office and waving a folded piece of paper. "I got the job!"

Filbert took the letter from her outstretched hand and unfolded it as she skipped around the table. It was a printout of an email from the Chief Executive, nominating her to direct the Department of Health.

"Congratulations," Filbert said. "You're getting pretty close!"

"He mentioned my 'indomitable courage in the face of danger,'" she bragged, beaming.

Filbert handed the letter to Sullivan, who quickly skimmed it. "What happened to the previous director?" Sullivan asked.

"She quit," Stacy II gloated. "Couldn't take the pressure. Something about her children being kidnapped or whatever. Good initiative, Filbert!" she added.

Filbert shook his head as if to disclaim responsibility.

Sullivan glared at Filbert. "You've gotta rein in your squad," he said, pulling out his phone, pulling up an article, and pushing it across the table. "This is getting out of hand."

Stacy II leaned over Filbert's shoulder to read the headline.

"Bombing at Department of Commerce Headquarters," it read.

Stacy II moved next to him to get a better view of the screen. It got worse. "Twelve killed, thirty injured in fourth terror attack this week," she read aloud.

Filbert pushed the phone back across the table to Sullivan. "That wasn't us," he said. "We've been laying low since the casino."

"Bullshit," Sullivan responded.

"I'm serious! It wasn't us!"

"Do you actually know that?" Sullivan challenged him. "What about those savages you imported from the penal colony? What are they doing when you're not watching them?"

"Probably binge watching _Sex and the City_", Filbert laughed. "They discovered it two days ago and have already made it up to Season Four."

Sullivan opened his mouth, and after a few seconds to take in this newfound information, closed it again without saying anything.

"I'm positive it wasn't anyone in my crew," Filbert reassured him.

Stacy II wasn't so sure. "Then who was it?" she demanded. "And who kidnapped the director's kids, if not you?"

Filbert bit his bottom lip.

"I can't say for sure," he said cautiously, "but...it could be wannabe recruits. We've been getting bombarded with emails."

Stacy II stared at him incredulously. This was an unexpected development. "People are bombing government offices and kidnapping children to try to join your domestic terror squad?" she asked.

"Balaclava guy's domestic terror squad," Filbert corrected her. "My squad doesn't exist, remember?"

"Do you respond to their emails?" Sullivan asked. "Do you let them join balaclava guy's squad?"

"Of course not! I assumed half the emails are from feds."

"And the other half? Are they just going to keep wreaking terror until balaclava guy responds?"

Filbert looked down at the desk. He didn't appear to be enjoying this interrogation.

As for Stacy II, she was only just beginning to process the implications.

"What are you going to do," she asked slowly, "when I win? How are you going to stop the attacks once I become Chief Executive?"

Filbert swallowed. He didn't appear to have thought of that.

Stacy II walked back from the co-working space towards the Department of Health, deep in thought. Would Filbert be able to rein in the kidnappers? How would that even work - was he going to email them, asking them politely to stop?

It was a concerning situation. She was so wrapped up in it that she didn't notice a moving van pull up next to her. Only when three men emerged from it, grabbed her, and forced her into the van, did she realize what was happening. She had been kidnapped - exactly the same way as she'd done to the cow. How fitting.

Two of the men entered the back of the van with her and beat her. Not too badly - just enough to daze and subdue her. She considered screaming as her face was forced into the floor and her hands cuffed behind her back, but decided against it - screaming wasn't particularly regal. If she was going to be kidnapped and murdered, she wanted her final moments to at least be dignified.

The van stank. A gag was forced into her mouth and her assailants kicked her until she rolled into - other people?

She wasn't the only kidnappee in the van. Well, that was something at least. Maybe she wasn't going to be murdered just yet.

The van took off with a screech and she was thrown around the moving compartment like a ragdoll.

---

Stacy II prayed to Steve. She prayed harder than she'd ever prayed in her life. He didn't answer.

What a useless God, she thought.

She thought back over all the hardships she'd endured in the name of Steve. Everything she'd been through - the death of mother, the failed military campaigns, the indignity of white-collar office work - all for a God who, when the chips were down, was nowhere to be found.

He was meant to be all-powerful. All-knowing. All-loving. She had served him loyally since the day she was born.

Why, then, had he forsaken her?

The door of the moving van slid open and light flooded into the cargo hold. She was finally able to make out her fellow hostages. There were five of them - three adults, dressed in filthy and quickly disintegrating business-casual office attire, and two children who looked scared and hungry.

Two of the kidnappers entered. They wore masks. One of them held a gun to her head and pulled down her gag. The other, who appeared to be in charge, held up a phone.

"Give me the number of someone who cares about you," he demanded.

Stacy II almost laughed when she heard his voice. He sounded like he was still in the latter stages of puberty.

"You can't keep us here like this," she said.

"Shut up!"

"We need a toilet."

"You have a toilet." The immature teenager who'd kidnapped her nodded to the overflowing bucket that had been screwed to the wall of the cargo hold.

Stacy II screwed up her face. No wonder it stank.

"It's unsanitary," she objected.

The leader smacked her. "Number!" he shouted.

Stacy II held back her tears and rattled off the number of Filbert's burner.

He dialed the number. Filbert picked up. After a brief introduction, the teenager held the phone up to Stacy II's mouth.

"Tell him we'll kill you if he doesn't cough up two kilos of gold," he instructed.

Stacy II told Filbert that the kidnappers would kill her if he didn't cough up two kilos of gold.

The kidnapper took the phone away before she could hear his response.

"More instructions to follow," he said into the microphone before hanging up.

The other kidnapper wrestled her gag back into her mouth, dropped her on the floor of the van, and shuffled out.

The leader followed him out, but turned around before shutting the door.

"Look," he said in his awkward adolescent voice. "I'm sorry about the...sanitary conditions. We're a startup, okay? This is a lean operation. We have to be scrappy."

Stacy II made unspecific objecting noises through her gag.

"We're working on a partnership," the kidnapper said. "Just...bear with us."

With that, he slid the door shut and Stacy II was plunged back into darkness.

---

The van stayed parked and the door stayed shut. The only indication of the passage of time was the darkening and disappearance of the slivers of daylight that shone through the breathing holes drilled in the wall. 

Stacy II eventually relented and subjected herself to the embarrassment of relieving herself in the bucket. She almost cried, and prayed that none of the other hostages recognized her.

Then, she remembered that there was no point in praying to an absent God who...did he even exist?

Maybe the voices in her head had been her imagination the whole time. Maybe the stories her mom had told her had been nothing but fables that old people tell to children to make them behave.

Maybe she'd killed all those people for nothing.

Alighting from the bucket, she adjusted her clothing to the best of her abilities and wriggled back to her corner of the cargo hold. Tears soaked her face and she was grateful for the darkness. As long as she kept her crying silent, no one else had to know.

---

After two days, the stench was intolerable. She choked on the stale air every time she breathed. Her throat was so parched from thirst that she genuinely expected her imminent death. And what would follow? Would she be reunited with her mom? Spend an eternity in the afterlife with God, and angels, and harps, and fluffy clouds?

Probably not. Probably, nothing would follow. The pattern of atoms making up the purely deterministic machine of her brain would fall apart, her mortal torment would end, and she would return to the state she was in before she was born.

Nothing. Absolutely nothing would follow. And by God, was it preferable to this.

The van started up. It took off with a jerk and took off down the road.

---

The van stopped. A few minutes later, the door slid open, and daylight streamed in. She clamped her eyes shut and recoiled from the light.

As she slowly opened her eyes, she recognized her surroundings. They were at the warehouse. What?

"Solid gold," the lead kidnapper said proudly, gesturing at her and the other hostages.

Filbert came into view. What?

He looked into the van, briefly made eye contact, and kept scanning. 

"People are going to pay gold for these?" he asked the kidnapper. "They look like you dug them out of a septic tank."

"We might have to clean them up a bit."

"Is this where you've been keeping them?" Filbert asked.

"Yeah," the kidnapper replied, wrinkling his nose. "Now you see why we need a new base of operations?"

"You'd better clean them up before you bring them in," Filbert said. "There's a hose out back. And our fee's gone up. I want twenty percent."

The lead kidnapper bristled, but didn't attempt to negotiate. Stacy II was dragged out, briefly blasted in freezing hose water, and shoved into the familiar warehouse. One of the kidnappers removed her gag and gave her a bottle of water. She downed it greedily before the gag was put back on.

Well, she thought as the other hostages were dragged in and given the same treatment one by one, this was a development. Maybe Steve cared after all, and it just took him some time to get around to things.

Perhaps, she thought, he just had a lot going on.
