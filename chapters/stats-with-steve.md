# 43. Stats with Steve

When he first saw the effect that the MHI-10's disconnection had on the PR, Russell couldn't stop giggling. He'd forgotten about the unmaintainable sewage system. Making it independent of the computer had been near the bottom of his todo list for decades - something more important always kept cropping up. Now, as the sins of his negligence were being paid for by the people who'd voted to nationalize his assets and ultimately torture and kill him, he found himself grateful that he'd kicked that can down the road. 

"Should we do something?" asked Stacy, halfheartedly. She wasn't particularly fond of the PR's population either.

"I don't think we could, even if we wanted to," replied Russell, gesturing at the large screen on the wall of the diner. "This TV only goes one way."

Eventually, they grew bored of flipping through channels. The next time Steve was in the diner, Russell let his frustration show.

"How come there are eight billion channels and nothing's ever on?" he complained.

Steve looked at him in surprise. "There's always something on," he replied. "Have you tried watching a telenovela?" He took the remote from Russell and flicked the TV to a previously unexplored channel. "I love this one," he chuckled, and sat down in the booth next to Stacy.

Russell and Stacy watched the screen for a few minutes, curiously. Eventually, Stacy piped up.

"Steve, I think this is just the actual life of an ordinary Brazilian lady."

"Oh! Is it? I can never tell the difference."

Russell groaned.

"Shall we try a K-drama instead?"

Russell changed the subject. "How are our stats?" he asked, referring to the alignment competition.

Steve sparked into life. He loved talking stats. He flicked the TV over to a dashboard filled with charts and numbers.

"In absolute terms, our Gross Souls Saved has barely moved in the past week. Still lagging way behind the competition. But look at this pipeline!" He gestured at a section of the screen. "The TD's been taking off like a rocket ship. First derivative is looking great. Second is a bit dodgy. Did something change recently?"

Stacy gave him a "you can't be seriously asking that" look.

"Ah, right," said Steve. "Anyway, the TD's killing it. Excellent work there, Stacy."

Stacy smiled. She hadn't exactly ruled with a light touch. The Theocratic Dominion had a state-mandated religion, and reproductive-age women were barred from every profession outside of nursing. Her crude and inelegant policies, while inspiring ire among the global population, were wildly popular among the self-selected citizenry of the TD. Their success was reflected in the stats - both in absolute numbers and on a per capita basis, the TD had more useful, aligned, ready-to-harvest souls than anywhere else on the planet.

The Anarchy, in second place, was catching up. Stacy wasn't sure how Vincent had managed to achieve the twin goals of "high fertility and alignment to Steve" without setting any policies whatsoever, other than giving people a ton of space and encouraging them to live risky lives surrounded by dinosaurs and other dangerous beings. In truth, the success of his strategy annoyed her.

The PR, finally, was an abysmal failure. Russell was so ashamed with his miserable numbers that he couldn't bear to look at the screen. He studied the diner menu for the hundred thousandth time instead. Reproductive rates in the People's Republic were some of the lowest in the world. Unmoved by staggeringly expensive incentive programs, most people simply refused to pair up and make children. Furthermore, despite living on an artificial island whose very existence was owed to recent intervention by a well-documented deity, very few people cared about the alignment meme at all. The citizens generally considered the entire idea to be "old-fashioned", "culty", and "lame".

The more time he spent thinking about people, the more he grew to dislike them. Russell much preferred computers.

"Say," he asked Steve, "is there any programming I can help you with? I have programmed an MHI-10 before, after all."

Steve stroked his chin. "You know, there is something that Murdoch's been bugging me about. We'll have to wait for Vincent to join us, though." He flicked the channel over to Vincent's, who was standing on some sort of flying island, engrossed in conversation with his son. "Could happen any day," he mused.
