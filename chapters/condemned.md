## 0. Condemned

Filbert avoided meeting Stacy II's eyes. Still gagged and chained in the hostage corner, her glare had somehow managed to get even more impatient. Filbert didn't need that kind of pressure.

He watched Blake and Archibald stroll nonchalantly into their position behind the couch, handguns awkwardly jammed into their pants behind their backs. He wasn't sure that the New Australians had ever operated firearms before, and regretted not having spent time on a range training them up.

With any luck, he hoped, they wouldn't have to fire them today either.

Once the final two reached their positions, the entire team was ready. Filbert felt their eyes on him as he stepped towards the three unsuspecting members of doomsquad69, drew his pistol, and-

_Bang._ The explosion sent Filbert reeling, as his eyes burned with white and his ears rang with the high-pitched squeal of a braking freight train.

_Bang._ Another flash grenade exploded, farther away this time. The warehouse began to fill with smoke. Filbert's brain finally figured out what was happening as the staccato of automatic gunfire broke through his ringing ears.

"Everyone down!" he shouted. "Cover doors and windows!"

A door was flung open, and he watched helplessly as one of his team members ran out and was immediately felled by automatic gunfire. Someone screamed, and the rest drew their handguns.

Harold and the rest of doomsquad69 looked at all the suddenly-armed people around them, dumbfounded. Harold caught Filbert's eye and opened his mouth, but Filbert never heard what he had to say. Another warehouse door was flung open and the black uniform-clad Commonwealth Special Forces began pouring in.

His team opened fire. The isolated pops from their handguns were met by rapid bursts from the Special Forces' automatic weapons. They were horrendously outgunned. Crouching down and praying that the hostages were unharmed, Filbert groped his way back to the armory. On his way, he bumped into Annabel.

"Pigs!" she shouted at him.

He didn't respond, just grabbed her arm, pulled her into the gun-filled broom closet, and handed her a pair of railguns.

"Hand them out!" he explained.

Annabel nodded and peeked round the door frame, before yelping and retreating. A short three-round burst of gunfire followed and punctured tiny holes in the thin, corrugated steel far wall of the closet.

Filbert stared at the cowering, terrified young woman in front of him and realized that he'd as good as killed her. Playing domestic terrorist is all fun and games when you're on the leading foot, but what now? By enlisting her into his squad, he'd basically condemned her to death. She was dead, he was dead, and Stacy II would probably be killed in the crossfire as well.

"Goddamn it," he muttered, slumping against the wall.

"We're dead, aren't we?" asked Annabel, forcing a weak smile. The sound of gunfire continued in the background, although the shots were becoming less frequent.

"Pretty much," he replied. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be," she said. "I get to see my dad again."

Filbert's eyes opened. He'd been so focused on their domestic conflicts and Stacy II's ascension that he'd forgotten the big picture. There were Gods around.

"Steve!" he thought, clamping his eyes shut and balling his fists. "Steve Steve Steve!"

"What are you doing?" Annabel asked, looking at his weirdly scrunched up face.

"Shut up!" he explained, and continued trying to summon Steve.
