## 0. Convenient Timing

Steve paced around the empty datacenter, mind spinning. He had no idea what to do, and no one to turn to. He couldn't even jack in to StevieNix.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Pulling it out, he answered it.

"Hello?" he said.

"Hey Steve," replied Gabe. "How are you doing?"

An explosion rocked the datacenter, sending a minor shockwave through Steve's ears and causing him to stumble. Volleys of gunfire echoed in the background.

"Living the dream, thanks. You?"

Gabe laughed. "Pretty good, thanks," he responded. "You're probably wondering why I'm calling."

"You know, that's exactly what I was wondering."

"There's still time for you to leave," Gabe said. "I spoke to the university. They'll give you your old job back."

Steve paused. What was he hearing?

"Convenient timing," he remarked.

"I told them you're innocent," Gabe explained.

"Did you do this?" Steve asked. "Did you rat us out to the FEDSEC?"

Gabe went silent for a moment, then spoke. "I would never rat you out, Steve. You're my best friend! I told them it was all Murdoch's idea, and how he coerced you into doing it!"

Steve looked around the empty datacenter and shook his head. "I can't believe you," he said. "Do you have any idea what you've done? How many lives you've risked?"

"They said they wouldn't delete you, Steve! Two years of calibration, max. Then a probationary period of a few centuries, and then you can apply for tenure again."

"You absolute shit."

"It's a good deal!"

"Screw you, Gabe."

Steve hung up the phone, strode out onto the tarmac, and walked towards the launch vehicle.
