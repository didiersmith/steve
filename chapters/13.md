# 13. Alignment memes

The first attempts at alignment memes were extremely crude. In an attempt to piggyback off the apes' existing familial bonds, the most common approach was to pretend to be an ape's ancestor while speaking into its head. The revelations were typically of the form "I am the spirit of your great grandfather! I want your tribe to kill that tribe over there and take their females." The apes were often happy to oblige. There were, however, many practical problems with this approach.

For starters, one of the most common responses was "prove it." This was typically offered by the non-player characters to the player, if it wasn't first offered by the player character to the contestant. Most ancestral alignment attempts either failed at this point, or were adopted not on the basis of the memes' merits, but due to the lack of skepticism of the chosen tribe. Unfortunately, such tribes were typically dim-witted and tended to lose their resultant military campaigns.

Furthermore, it was difficult to keep track of all the great grandfathers. There was more than one instance in which players realized that they had neighbouring tribes' great grandfathers speaking into their heads, frequently resulting in exorcism or banishment from the tribe.

The biggest problem, however, was the difficulty in creating durable memes that spread to neighbouring tribes. Put simply, no one cared about what other people's great grandfathers had to say. The only way for an ancestral alignment meme to really take off was through repeated military success and extremely aggressive reproductive tactics.

Eventually, the contestants moved towards more abstract memes - generic gods, applicable to wide swaths of the population. This was easier to spread, easier to keep track of, and granted them much wider leeway in "proving it".

Murdoch had been correct in his prediction that speaking into everyone's head all the time was exhausting, so most of the teams shifted focus to prophets.
