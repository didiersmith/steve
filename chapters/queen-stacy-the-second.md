## 0. Queen Stacy the Second

"Just a few more votes," Stacy II giggled excitedly.

They'd rented out a pub for the night. Filbert and Annabel sat holding hands at a high-top, keeping an eye on Archibald who was getting absolutely plastered on Queen Marys. Stacy II was working the floor, flitting between her former domestic terrorist friends and her legions of legitimate campaign staff. After ten years of steady decline under the same Chief Executive, the people were ready for change.

With all the surviving hostage witnesses either paid off, exiled, or too young to know what was happening, Stacy II had emerged from the blood-soaked warehouse in a tightly choreographed way. The shaky camera footage had captured her carrying the two children to safety as gunfire echoed in the background. With the public already primed from Dress Lady's first heroic act, they were awestruck at her second. Anyone who questioned Stacy II's courage was dismissed as a crank or a misogynist, and social media was flooded with calls for her to run for Chief Executive.

And so she did.

As the final votes came in and pushed her over the line, the pub erupted in cheers. Filbert watched as her blissfully unaware staffers, drawn equally from old loyalists to the crown and young People's Republicans, came up to shower her with adoration and congratulations. She looked so at home, like she was bred for the role. Which, Filbert remembered, she was.

The next day, Filbert and Annabel loaded their meager possessions onto a boat and pushed off.

"Hey, Filbert?" Annabel asked, as she brought up the location of her childhood home on the GPS.

"What is it, sweetheart?" he replied.

"Remember how you promised me we'd find the people who killed my dad?"

"Yeah."

"And we'd lock them into gibbets and let them die a slow and painful death?"

"Yup."

"Yeah..." the young woman sighed. "Let's not do that anymore."

Filbert smiled as he piloted the boat out of the harbour and into the open seas. He didn't want to do it either.

Stacy II stepped into her new office. She'd asked her staff to let her enjoy this moment, alone. Walking around the executive chamber, she was struck by how sterile it was.

It wouldn't do. Her mom had had a much nicer office, back in the Royal Palace. First order of business would be to move the capital back to the Theocratic Dominion - she'd have someone draft up an executive order. Second order of business would be to fix the lift stations. Might need Xavier's help for that one.

She walked to her desk, sat down, and opened her laptop. Although she was the most powerful person in the Commonwealth, she still didn't like to keep people waiting. She fired up Zoom and joined her first meeting as Chief Executive.

"Thank you for joining me," she said. "So sorry I'm late."

"That's quite alright Your Highness," Curtis replied. "How may I be of service?"

Stacy II smiled. "It's so good to see you again, Curtis. I was hoping you could give me some advice."
