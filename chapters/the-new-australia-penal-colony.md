## 0. The New Australia Penal Colony

It was a long journey to New Australia. The penal colony had been deliberately placed a very long distance from anywhere. Anywhere except Antarctica, that was. Stacy II was freezing.

After days of travel, they finally arrived. Filbert steered the boat up the mouth of an estuary and ran the boat ashore on a sandy embankment.

"I've gotta pee," he announced, and wandered off into the bush.

Stacy II clambered off the boat. Not a very ladylike descent. She was glad that no one was around to witness it. She was beginning to regret her haste in departing for the penal colony - it would have been much smarter to spend a bit more time in the Anarchy and re-supply. Get some warmer clothes. Perhaps hire more useful assistance than Filbert.

"Hello hello hello! What have we here?" rang out a deep voice. "Untended human capital, just hanging out by the river?"

Stacy II turned and saw two figures stride out of the bush. An older man, somewhere between his thirties and his fifties - it was hard to tell from his scarred, weatherbeaten face - and a scrawny young teenager, who looked to be around fourteen. Both were clad in animal furs and holding spears.

"What do you reckon lad, have we struck gold?" continued the older man, licking his lips.

"Heh. Yes boss, seems like an, er, prime investment opportunity," responded the kid.

Stacy II looked around for her railgun. She'd left it next to the boat, several meters away. Without hesitating, she leapt to her feet and started sprinting towards the gun.

The man roared and charged. He tackled her well before she reached the gun. He pinned her on the ground by her throat and tore at her clothing with his other hand.

Stacy II clawed helplessly at his face. Judging by the scars, she wasn't the first. Then, as the sheer helplessness of her situation dawned on her, the side of his chest exploded. Liters of blood spilled out onto her as she struggled to free herself from under the man's now lifeless corpse.

Finally, she wriggled free and stood up. Her clothes were saturated with blood and the contents of her assailant's internal organs. She surveyed the situation. Filbert had returned from his pee break and had his railgun aimed at the kid, who was cowering on the ground.

"Couldn't have done that a bit sooner?" she asked, annoyed.

"It was a tricky shot!" he responded. "What with you flailing about and everything."

"Oh, next time I'll just lie there passively then."

"Just saying, you're lucky I didn't blow your leg off."

Stacy II grumbled. In a way, Filbert was right - but so was she. Flailing had been a reasonable choice. How was she supposed to have known that he'd suddenly become useful?

"You should wash yourself off," Filbert advised. "You don't know where that guy's been."

He was right again. The man's blood was probably infested with disease. AIDS, perhaps. She waded into the freezing river and did her best to clean the blood off. She emerged shortly thereafter, teeth chattering and chilled to the bone.

"I'm going to freeze to death," she said.

"Take the dead guy's clothes," Filbert suggested, still not taking his eyes or railgun off the kid.

"It's covered in AIDS."

Filbert thought for a second before coming up with a solution. "Hey kid! Take off your clothes and throw them here. You can wear the AIDS clothes."

The kid complied. In short order, the corpse was naked, the terrified kid was sitting next to it in the man's blood-soaked furs, and Stacy II had obtained kid's furs. Shaking, she moved behind Filbert to change into the warm furs. She guessed they had once belonged to a bear.

Once she was done, she picked up her railgun and addressed the kid.

"What's your name?" she asked.

"Archibald," he answered. "But everyone calls me Baldy."

Stacy II couldn't help but laugh. "Do you like being called Baldy?" she asked.

"No."

"Do you prefer Archie?"

"I prefer Archibald."

"Archibald it is. I'm Queen Stacy the Second. You may address me as Your Royal Highness."

"Okay."

"'Okay, Your Royal Highness.'"

"Okay, Your Royal Highness."

"Good. Now, do you understand what this does?" she asked, brandishing her railgun.

"Yes, Your Royal Highness."

"Good. So you know what happens if you try to touch me, or run away, or disobey any of my orders?"

"Yes, Your Royal Highness."

"Excellent. Now, tell us how things work in this godforsaken dump."

Archibald was not a sociologist. Describing how one's society functions would be a difficult task for any fourteen-year-old, let alone one who'd never received a formal education. Still, over the next hour, Stacy II was able to get a fairly decent picture: New Australia was the pits of hell.

When her mother and Vincent had designed the island twenty years ago, they had not endowed it with a wealth of natural resources. The island had fresh water, dirt, trees, and animals. There were no minerals - not even the rocks necessary to enter the stone age. Filbert jokingly called it the "bone age," which was accurate - all tools were fashioned out of wood and bone.

The only other resource was human beings, to whom Archibald unironically referred as "human capital." The most valuable human capital was reproductive-aged women. The criminal population of the Theocratic Dominion had had a lopsided sex ratio of twenty males to every female, so that ratio was naturally inherited in the convict population of New Australia. Babies were, of course, born in a 50:50 sex ratio, but by the time the native-born girls had reached reproductive age, a culture had already formed. The culture made Stacy II want to execute every male in the colony.

Archibald described his mother's life as an illustrative example. She had been transported in her early twenties for the crime of attempting to smuggle phthalate-containing beauty products to the Dominion. She had been captured immediately upon exiting the hyperloop station, and forced to marry some brute. He had been killed by his brother, who took over the marriage. The brother was subsequently beaten and exiled by another challenger, so she changed hands again, and so on and so forth until the present day. Archibald wasn't sure who his father was. He was the eldest of six half siblings.

His current stepfather was some tyrant who had rented Archibald out to the man Filbert had just killed. An "apprennership," he'd called it. As Archibald's mother was now leaving her reproductive years and his twelve-year-old sister was entering hers, his stepfather intended to convert his mother to public property and his sister to his new wife. An elaborate ceremony had been planned.

"'Public property?'" asked Stacy II.

"Yeah, you know. A communally owned resource. For the common good and all."

"And you don't see a problem with this?"

Archibald avoided her glare. "There was a vote, Your Royal Highness," he responded meekly.

Filbert's ears pricked at the word 'vote' and asked for elaboration. As Archibald explained the process, it became clear what 'voting' meant in New Australia. It was an elaborate ceremony used to justify actions that a despot intended to perform anyway.

"And then old mate stepdad counted the ballots and told us what the consensus was," Archibald concluded. Stacy II and Filbert nodded, sarcastically. "The people have spoken, right? So tonight, she becomes property of the collective. Vox populi, vox dei, you know?"

"Sounds like we arrived at the perfect time," Stacy II said to Filbert.

"Sounds like this sort of thing happens every day," Filbert responded.

"You're not planning on causing any trouble, are you?" Archibald asked. "You may not like it, but it's a system. It's law and order. Without it, we'd be savages. Hobbesian state of nature and all."

Filbert laughed. "This is the Hobbesian state of nature, you dolt! Nasty, brutish, short, the lot of it!"

Archibald glared. "That's not true! We're law-abiding citizens. We go to work! We pay our taxes!"

"Taxes?" Stacy II asked.

Archibald explained. Every few years, the tax collectors would do their rounds. Each family would have to give up their youngest child. Two of Archibald's siblings had been taxed as babies - a boy, and a girl.

"What do the tax collectors do with them?" Filbert asked.

"Take them to the city, of course," replied Archibald.

They interrogated more details out of him. The "city" was the territory surrounding the most valuable source of human capital - the hyperloop station. New arrivals, male or female, would be captured upon exiting the station and either sold, wed, or put into "public service." Many battles had been fought in the early days over the station, but one gang had eventually won out. For Archibald's entire life, the station, and by extension most of New Australia, had been under control of that gang - the House of Lords. They maintained their dominance the same way Archibald's stepdad did - with an iron fist, strategic "votes," and "public property."

"What happens to the 'taxes?'" asked Stacy II.

"They get communally raised in the city. When they're old enough, they get put into service for the good of the public," Archibald responded. "The boys usually get their bits cut off and put to work in the fields and whatnot, and the girls...uh -"

Filbert cut him off. "I think we understand what happens to the girls."

"They call it 'administrative overhead,'" Archibald finished. "Until they're old enough to become public property."

Stacy II retched. "You don't see anything wrong with paying your siblings as 'tax' to be used as 'public property' and 'administrative overhead?'"

"Look, no one likes paying tax, but it's just the price we pay to live in a civil society," responded Archibald, indignantly. "Your Royal Highness," he hastily added.
