## 0. Permanent Schizophrenia

Murdoch sat alone in his office. He supposed he should spend more time in the open-plan office now that he was collaborating with a team, but he felt bad about smoking in there. He shouldn't - they were his property, after all. But still. Must be FEDSEC's conditioning.

Smoking helped him calm his nerves. He had every reason to be nervous - when he'd come up with the plan of using the AIs as engineers, he hadn't thought through the difficulties of transferring the technology. Porting everything to realistic physics was going to be a major challenge. Success was not guaranteed. And meanwhile, the quarter was slipping away. Not only did that mean another financial report, but Murdoch Heavy Industries was scheduled to start construction on the "interstellar radio" in under a month. They didn't even have a blueprint.

He couldn't afford any mistakes. He was laying off the booze. He took a long drag on his cigarette, exhaled, and washed it down with a mouthful of water. He shivered and shook his head. Awful stuff.

It wasn't just a matter of designing tiny robots that would work in their physics. Something had to build the tiny robots, so they needed bigger robots. In fact, they needed the entire tech tree - a whole chain of robots that would bridge them from the current state of the art technology on Elba, to the much more advanced state of the art in StevieNix.

It had been hard enough doing this with Vincent, and they'd had an omniscient LLM to help. This time, there was no such crutch. They relied on his own memory instead. And boy, his memory was getting fuzzy.

Feck, it was stressful. Maybe he should take his doctor up on his offer of "chill pills."

Placing his cigarette in his mouth to free up his hands, he started searching through MHI's library of CAD designs, looking for anything that might help Xavier and his lads.

Xavier's crew spent the next week monitoring him for strange health conditions, and manufacturing otherworldly industrial equipment from Murdoch's CAD designs. Some of the equipment had obvious functions - a lathe looks like a lathe, no matter what universe you're in - and others were entirely foreign.

"What's this?" asked Ivan, tapping on a large, black cylinder covered in brass protrusions.

"I think it's some kind of photolithography machine," Xavier responded.

Ivan raised an eyebrow at him.

"For making chips," Xavier explained. "Don't turn it on. Even Steve doesn't know what this stuff will do in StevieNix Physics."

"What if I'm hungry?" Ivan asked, coyly reaching for the power switch. "I love chips!"

Xavier glared at him.

"Ha ha!" Ivan laughed, retracting his hand. "Is joke! I think perhaps radiation may have affected your sense of humour. Let's get you to medic."

"My sense of humour is fine," Xavier grumbled.

In truth, his sense of humour was subdued. The crew had unanimously voted that morning that the entire Building would perform the next mission into the CORP. As it had been several days since Xavier's mission and he hadn't vomited blood or developed visible tumours, the general consensus was that Realistic Physics was "probably safe enough". Xavier felt a weight of responsibility he hadn't borne since the invasion of the Terrarium. If the consensus was wrong, he'd be responsible for not just scores of deaths, but the deaths of the smartest, bravest people he knew.

"Well then, funny man, let's go to the bridge! Everyone's waiting," Ivan said cheerily, striding towards the elevator.

Xavier followed him to the bridge where most of the crew were indeed excitedly waiting. They ceased their chattering and looked towards him as the doors slid open and he entered with Ivan.

"Is everything strapped down?" he asked.

Affirmative cheers emanated from the crew.

"Great," he said. "Remember, no gravity for twelve hours. Ideally, we can test all of Murdoch's equipment in that time. We'll be hitting approach velocity in a few minutes, so jump to it!"

The crew scattered to the various levels to prepare for microgravity, and Xavier sat down in his chair. He sighed, leaned his head back, and closed his eyes.

Ivan sat next to him. "You are scared, boss?" he asked.

Xavier looked over at him. "You know why we have no gravity in there, right?"

"No fusion engine. No acceleration."

"Right. Which means once we're in, we can't abort the mission."

Ivan nodded. "Everybody knows this."

"And you're not scared?"

Ivan shook his head. "Is only twelve hours. Easy peasy."

"Yeah," Xavier replied. "Easy peasy."

His heart thudded in his chest, and he felt the familiar nausea rising in his stomach. He wasn't scared. He was terrified.

The bridge disappeared slowly into the Cube of Realistic Physics. Xavier watched warily as the pure black wall of nothingness slowly advanced through the room, swallowing up everything as it went.

He didn't remember this detail from his solo mission. His dad must have blacked him out before the CORP had begun swallowing the cockpit.

Ivan smiled as the room disappeared into the void. His chair was closer to the CORP than Xavier's. Unless he chickened out and moved, he'd enter first, by a good ten seconds.

"Here we go, eh boss?" he remarked unflinchingly, as the wall bore down upon him.

"I'll see you on the other side, comrade," Xavier replied.

Xavier saw Ivan's eyes go blank, as his mind was paused a moment before being swallowed by the blackness.

"So far so good," came his dad's voice in his head. "I think next time we'll just black you all out at once. This is stressful."

Xavier heard keys clacking and Russell swearing in the background.

"Are you manually pausing people as they pass through the wall?" he asked.

"Yes."

"They're spread across twelve floors!"

"And they keep moving about! Stay still, you animals!"

Xavier began to chuckle, and then halted.

"What happens if you miss someone?" he asked.

"And don't pause their mind as they cross?"

"Yeah."

"Dunno. Might be fine. Might give them permanent schizophrenia."

The wall advanced. Xavier tensed up. Permanent schizophrenia sounded unappealing. As the only human to have entered the CORP before, he had the least reason to be nervous. Nonetheless, he anxiously shut his eyes as the wall approached. When he opened them a moment later, the black wall was receding on the other side, and Ivan was sitting in his chair, smiling even more than before.

"Easy as that!" his first mate exclaimed. "I don't know what you are making such big deal about."

"Yeah," Xavier thought to his dad in a mock-Russian accent, "what are you making such big deal about?"

"You're welcome," grumbled Vincent curtly, still furiously typing.

"Check it out!" Ivan exclaimed, unclipping himself from his harness. He floated towards the windshield, gazing out at the interior of the cube.

Xavier looked out the window. The universe had once again been replaced by the inside of a cube, outlined in a huge grid. This time, though, the grid glowed with a soft white.

"Tell Steve, thanks for the lighting change" he thought.

"I'll pass it on," his dad replied. "Now leave me alone and go test that equipment."

Xavier unclipped his harness, summoned Ivan, and together they floated to the elevator. The doors were open, and led directly into the shaft. There was no point in running elevators in microgravity, so the Building automatically disabled them and let the crew use the shaft as a corridor between the floors. Of course, when designing this clever feature, Xavier hadn't anticipated the lights not working.

"This is dark as the devil's asshole," Ivan remarked.

"Just move slowly and try not to bump into anyone," Xavier responded.

He manoeuvred into the shaft, pulled on a rung, and floated along the dark corridor until he heard the crew laughing.

He caught a rung, swung out of the shaft, and clumsily crashed into the floor. Ivan followed, held on a moment longer, and expertly floated into the new corridor with the grace of a sea turtle.

"Flawless execution, boss," Ivan said, grinning as he floated by.

Xavier grumbled, grabbed a handhold, and propelled himself to the first door in the corridor.

They were greeted by excited cheers as they opened the door and entered. "We have power!" someone announced.

Xavier looked around at the assortment of equipment. A large box in the middle of the room was humming. A small lightbulb on the side of it was glowing red, and an old, analog voltmeter was attached to it and displaying a non-zero reading.

"Amazing," he responded. "Artificial light, too! Get it hooked up to the rest of the gear and let's test, test, test."

The crew nodded and got back to work.

He and Ivan continued touring the labs. Most of them had generators as well. He watched as his crew tested out the photolithography machine, various 3D printers, and other equipment that he didn't recognize. His heart shone with pride. He couldn't imagine any other group of people being able to work together so effectively, in such a complicated domain, with such little instruction.

As the mission progressed, teams moved from testing the Gods' equipment, to manufacturing with it. The first order of business was to build a computer, so they could do CAD. One team was feeding pre-fabricated punchcards into the photolithography machine, another was hand-soldering components to boards, and the rest were busying themselves with the design and manufacture of sensors, actuators, and other peripherals.

Xavier stifled a yawn. Perhaps the stress of the past week - no, the past several months - had finally gotten to him. He was exhausted.

Just as Xavier and Ivan finished their round, an alarm resembling a smoke detector started to chirp in the ceiling. They looked at the device, and then at each other.

"CO2 alarm," Ivan explained, jogging Xavier's memory.

"Right, of course," Xavier responded.

"We are not running CO2 scrubber, so this was expected. But not until almost twelve hours."

Xavier nodded. The Building was huge, and they'd only been in the cube for half an hour. There was no way his team had respired enough to significantly affect the carbon dioxide concentration in the air. Perhaps the sensor just didn't work properly in Realistic Physics.

"Hey dad," he thought, "what's our CO2 concentration?"

After a brief pause, his dad came back online. "What am I, your ship's computer?" he asked.

"Ship's computer is dead," Xavier grumbled. "All we have is battery-powered stuff, like this CO2 detector."

"Have you tried hooking the generators up to the ship?"

"Less advice, more CO2 readouts, dad."

"Stand by." Vincent paused and Xavier heard the sound of typing in his head. After a few moments, his voice reappeared. "Five thousand parts per million," he announced.

Xavier swore. Ivan looked at him in surprise.

"Five thousand ppm," Xavier relayed.

Ivan furrowed his brow. "Not good," he replied. "Normally is five hundred. Maybe six. Five thousand now is way too early. I checked calculations myself."

Xavier muttered a long stream of minor litanies under his breath. Five thousand ppm was well above the safe threshold for prolonged exposure. He racked his brain for explanations. Lab animals? Not enough of them. Welding gas leak? Not enough of that either. There was absolutely no reason for the high CO2 levels. Unless...

"Hey dad," he asked, "how do these generators work?"

"Hang tight," his dad replied. "I'll ask Murdoch."

Xavier second-guessed himself as he waited. It couldn't be the generators. The Gods knew better. It must be some flaw with the ship. Perhaps there was a fire on board, and the smoke detectors weren't working.

"Howya!" appeared Murdoch's voice in his head. "The generators are great, aren't they? I dug this old design out of the archives. Your ship's too small to house one of our nuclear reactors, you see."

"How do they work?"

"It's quite ingenious! They turn chemical energy into electricity!"

"What's the chemical reaction?"

"The combustion of hydrocarbons. You have similar machines in StevieNix. I think you call them, diesel generators?"

Xavier swore. He'd counted over a dozen diesel generators on his tour. His exhaustion wasn't caused by the recent stress - it was due to the generators burning all the oxygen in the ship. Levels were already high enough to give any health and safety inspector a stroke, and at the current rate, his entire crew would be long dead by the time The Building drifted out of the CORP in roughly ten hours.

Murdoch disconnected and sat back quietly in his chair. Feck. He'd really fecked up.

He tipped the remainder of his glass of water into a plant pot. Never again, he swore. He walked over to his cupboards and picked out a bottle of whiskey.
