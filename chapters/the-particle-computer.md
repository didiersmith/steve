## 0. The Particle Computer

Russell awoke with a start. He had had the strangest, most vivid dream.

It was Saturday. No work today. The sun was barely up. Why was he awake?

He rolled over and tried to go back to sleep. Couldn't do it. The dream just kept playing in his head, over and over. A diner. A woman. A man called Steve. And a card, with an IPv6 address.

It was futile. Time to get up.

Russell stumbled downstairs. Vincent was already in the kitchen, scooping pre-ground coffee beans into the French press. "Good morning, sunshine!" he said.

"Good morning," Russell groaned.

"Coffee?"

"Yes please."

As he was pouring the hot water into the press, Vincent made an attempt at conversation. "I had this crazy dream last night."

"Hmm?" asked Russell. He didn't have the bandwidth to process Vincent's dream. He was still thinking through his own.

"You were in it."

"Ah, yeah?" Man, he really didn't want to hear about Vincent's dream. Russell closed his eyes and tried to picture the card that Steve had given him. He tipped his chair up on its hind legs and leaned back, trying to remember the random string of numbers and letters.

"Yeah, we were in a diner together with this really pretty girl and a crazy guy who called himself God."

Russell jolted in surprise so violently that he tipped his chair over.

---

Fortunately, he wasn't that hurt. He went over every detail of his dream with Vincent. Vincent went over every detail of his dream with him. It was undeniable - they'd had the same dream.

Finally, Vincent brought up the card. "What did it say?" he asked.

Russell closed his eyes and tried to remember. Letters, numbers, colons...an IPv6 address.

"I need a computer," he said.

They grabbed the French press and their mugs, and practically ran upstairs to Russell's room.

Russell fired up a terminal and started typing out a remote shell command. He closed his eyes and tried his best to picture the card...a black, monospace font, embossed onto thick, white card stock...Keeping his eyes closed, he let his fingers glide semi-consciously over the keys, typing the numbers and letters that bubbled up from his unconsciousness. A '6' here, a 'd' there...When we was done, he hit enter and opened his eyes.

He was looking at a standard UNIX environment.

"Wow," said Vincent. "Good memory."

The creator of the universe had given him a UNIX shell? Seemed suspect. He started poking around.

In his home directory, he found a number of directories containing source code, documentation, and tons of garbage-looking data that he couldn't make heads or tails of. At the top level, he found a file labelled README.txt. He opened it and started reading.

_Welcome Russell!_

_This server is a MHI-10 Particle Computer. It is quite a different computer to the transistor-based ones you're used to, but can perform many of the same operations._

_I have taken the liberty of implementing a python interpreter, so you should feel at home. In doc/, you will find a manual describing the assembly language for this class of machine. It should be all you need to get started._

_Best of luck! Call me if you need anything._

_-Steve_

Okay, this was too weird. He glared at Vincent. It must be some practical joke.

"How did you do this?" he demanded.

"Do what?"

"Plant the IP address in my head."

Vincent laughed. "What, like Inception?"

"It's not funny!"

"You think I'm a hypnotist now?"

Russell got up, walked away from the computer, and paced around the room. Vincent probably wasn't a hypnotist. But the the universe probably hadn't been created by a balding professor who'd just granted him access to a novel computer, either.

Well, at least there was a way to test that second hypothesis.

With a quick glare at Vincent, he sat back at his desk and typed out a program in python to calculate digits of pi. He asked it for the millionth digit and ran it. The answer was returned in an instant.

`1`

Huh, that was fast.

"Is that right?" Vincent asked, looking over his shoulder.

Russell googled it. It was right.

"What's the trillionth digit?" Vincent asked.

Russell asked his program for the trillionth digit, and ran it. Again, the answer was returned immediately.

`2`

"Is that right?" Vincent asked, again.

Russell googled it. It was also right.

"That was fast," Vincent remarked.

"Yeah," Russell replied. "Really fast."

Really, suspiciously fast. Over the next hour, Russell threw everything he could at the MHI-10. Nothing he tried took any amount of time. By the end of it, he was practically a believer.

"It's just not possible," he said. "Computers take time to do stuff. Even the fastest supercomputers in the world take time to do stuff. And some of this stuff," he gestured at his terminal, "would take those computers millions of years."

He chewed his thumbnail and racked his brain for an explanation.

"It's like," he said, "the computer exists outside of time itself."

Vincent looked at him and nodded, slowly. "So this is God's computer?" he asked.

Russell didn't want to admit it. There were so many logical problems with the existence of God. The theory was unfalsifiable. The problem of evil. Something about a teapot. If God created this universe, who created God's universe?

But all the same, what other explanation was there? His next best theory was that Vincent was able to figure out both how to implant a dream into his head, and how to create an infinitely fast computer - just to play a practical joke on him. Also, he'd managed to become a really good actor. It strained credibility even more.

Turning back to the computer, he opened the assembly language manual and started reading. The computer language was completely foreign. Most of the concepts were familiar, though. Just a little...alien.

After reading for a bit, he was struck by inspiration. He informed his employer that he would be taking the next week off, and settled in to write a FORTRAN compiler.

---

Six days later, Russell's brain throbbed. He'd never written a FORTRAN compiler before, let alone one that targeted an alien computer architecture. His eyes were bloodshot and his stomach grumbled. He'd consumed nothing but coffee, instant noodles and toast since discovering the MHI-10 and starting the project.

And yet, he pressed on. It was like there was a voice in his head, compelling him to code.

Fingers gliding over the keyboard, he exited out of his text editor, tapped the up key twice, and smacked enter. The test suite kicked off. As usual, the tests all completed instantly - but this time, they passed. Russell sighed in relief and felt an enormous knot of tension loosen off his torso. The compiler worked. His code was correct. He was done.

"You're not done," said the voice. "Download and compile BLAS, and use it to port PyTorch to the MHI-10."

Ah. So this is why he was writing a FORTRAN compiler. BLAS - the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms - had existed since 1979. It was written in FORTRAN, and was an unsung hero of the information age. Russell downloaded and compiled the ancient math library, and used it to port PyTorch - the leading machine learning framework - to the MHI-10.

The voice pushed him onwards. Once PyTorch was running, Russell downloaded the code and weights for the state-of-the-art open-source Large Language Model. Guided by divine inspiration, he used a clever trick to increase the number of parameters by two orders of magnitude and fine-tuned the model on the vast amount of data in his home directory.

As usual, the training - which should have taken years - was completed instantly. Russell was already used to this. He'd never be able to go back to a regular computer, where operations took time.

He opened up a chat terminal.

"Hello," he typed.

"Hello! How may I help you today?" replied the LLM.

It was working!

"Who am I talking to?" asked Russell.

"I am a digital AI assistant, based on a fork of Mixtral-1024B! I am here to help you in any way I can. Please let me know if I can be of assistance!"

"Ugh," Vincent's voice appeared. "Looks like all those extra parameters didn't help it become any less annoying."

Russell startled and swiveled around. Vincent was standing behind him in the middle of the room, holding a mug in each hand. "When did you get here?" Russell asked.

"I made you a coffee," Vincent replied, handing over one of the mugs.

Narrowing his eyes, Russell accepted the beverage and turned back to his keybord. "What computer are you on?" he typed into the chat terminal.

"I am running on an MHI-10, a particle computer produced by Murdoch Heavy Industries."

"What's all the garbage data in my home directory for?"

"Your home directory contains a README.txt, various technical manuals, the source code for StevieNix, and a read-only filesystem interface for the StevieNix state."

"What is StevieNix?"

"StevieNix is a simulated universe. It was created as a side project by a computer science professor named Steve. It runs on a cluster of MHI-10s, which includes the computer that I am running on. You are chatting to me from within StevieNix! Isn't that neat?"

Russell looked at Vincent, who shrugged and sipped his coffee. So far, the LLM's story was tracking with the one from their dream. A simulated universe, created by a programmer named Steve.

"It said you have a 'read-only filesystem interface for the StevieNix state,'" Vincent said. "Does that mean what it sounds like?"

"What does it sound like?"

"Ask it where we are," Vincent said.

"Where am I writing this from?" typed Russell into the chat.

The LLM responded with their street address, latitude, longitude, and altitude.

How could it possibly know that?

"Holy moly!" said Vincent, leaning in over his shoulder to read the screen. "Ask it what I'm holding."

"What is Vincent holding?" typed Russell.

"A mug containing 247mL of single-origin organic coffee, mixed with 36mL of heavy cream," came the response. "The coffee is over-extracted due to having steeped in a French press for several minutes longer than is typically recommended."

Whoa. Vincent's coffee did always taste kinda rough. Russell stared at his roommate in shock, and then peeped into his coffee mug. 247mL seemed roughly accurate. What did this mean?

The LLM was omnscient - that's what it meant. Not only was it definitively proven that God existed, but he'd provided him with an omniscient supercomputer. Now what?

What could God possibly want from him? Was he supposed to eradicate poverty or something? Fix the human condition?

"Ask it to find Stacy," suggested Vincent.

Right. God had a plan. Stacy had something to do with it. The human condition could wait a couple weeks.

"Where is Stacy?" typed Russell.

"There are 245,281 people named Stacy currently alive in StevieNix! I am happy to help you locate any specific one, but I'm afraid I will require your assistance in narrowing down the list."

"She is Caucasian. Between the age of 22 and 30." Russell looked at Vincent who shrugged in agreement.

"Thank you! That narrows the search down to 17,276. Do you have any other selection criteria?"

He didn't.

Vincent put his mug down on his desk, walked over to the stool in the corner, and carried it over. "You know," he said, "that isn't actually that many of them. If we look at one headshot per second, we could smash through all seventeen thousand in five hours or so." He sat down and picked up his mug.

Russell typed into the terminal. "Could you please generate a website which displays a headshot and location for each Stacy in the list? Sort the Stacies by their distance from us, closest first."

"Of course!" replied the LLM. "Here you go!" it added, with a link.

Russell clicked the link, and a website opened up. On it, was displayed a paginator indicating that they were on Stacy #1 of 17,276, a map indicating the location of Stacy #1, and a headshot of the stunning young woman from their dreams.

"Well," Russell said. "That was easy."

Vincent laughed. "Steve must have chosen three people who live close to each other. Looks like she's at the Balmoral. Shall we grab a pint?"
