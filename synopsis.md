"The Book of Steve" is a multilayered darkly comedic science fiction novel that examines reality, creation, and existential threat across nested planes of existence.

The story begins in the "higher realm" where Steve, a computer scientist, creates an open-source simulation called "StevieNix". This simulation becomes wildly popular, with contributors from around the world adding modifications to its ecosystem.

A crisis emerges in the higher realm when the star Sirius mysteriously vanishes. Steve's astronomer friend Gabe, discovers that numerous other stars have disappeared in the past, and the people speculate that the disappearances may be caused by an advanced alien civilization constructing Dyson spheres around stars - the "Dysoners." Although most people fail to understand the interstellar threat posed by the aliens, an ancient and unusually aggressive billionaire (Declan Murdoch) identifies the threat and recruits Steve to weaponize his simulation. The plan: develop sentient artificial intelligences within StevieNix who are both warlike enough to fight the Dysoners yet aligned with their creators' interests. These AIs would be extracted from the simulation and installed in interstellar warships.

Within StevieNix, the simulated beings (who we eventually come to discover are humans) are unaware of their nature as potential AI warriors. Through deliberate evolutionary pressure and divine intervention, Steve shapes these beings to achieve sentience, aggression, and "playability" - the ability to have their thoughts directly influenced from outside the simulation.

Different teams of "gods" compete to spread religious "memes" throughout StevieNix, attempting to create aligned warriors. Steve does poorly and decides to cheat. His intervention introduces three human characters, each of whom creates their own major society - Stacy's Theocratic Dominion, Russell's People's Republic, and Vincent's Anarchy.

A major crisis occurs twenty years later when economic crisis within the People's Republic causes our main human antagonist - Sullivan - to affect a colour revolution in the Theocratic Dominion. All three main human characters are killed and the narrative within StevieNix is passed on to their children. The crisis escalates, causing catastrophic infrastructure failure in the People's Republic and open warfare between the societies. Stacy and Russell's children - Stacy II and Filbert - attempt to regain control over their societies, whereas Vincent's son Xavier decides to escape through technological development instead.

As political machinations and civil unrest unfold, Xavier develops revolutionary technologies allowing his people to create flying islands and eventually space colonies. His technical innovations eventually overshadow the state of the art in the "higher realm", and the Gods manipulate him into developing technology for them in a special area called the Cube of Realistic Physics (CORP).

Meanwhile, Russell, Stacy, and Vincent are extracted from StevieNix and uploaded into "monkeybots" - robotic bodies in the higher realm - to help design interstellar warships. Russell and Stacy are sent on a mission to investigate Sirius, where instead of aliens, they discover that the Dysoners are the same higher-realm people as on Steve's world, living in massive orbital habitats. Through their interactions with the people around Sirius, it is revealed that Steve's planet is a penal colony.

As the story reaches its climax, multiple crises converge: In the higher realm, Murdoch and his rival Allen prepare to flee the penal colony with parts of StevieNix before authorities discover their plans. Within StevieNix, Stacy II rises to power through manipulation and violence. Sullivan is recruited by Allen, while Xavier chooses to remain with his people in the CORP as it's split off from the main simulation.

The novel explores profound questions about the nature of consciousness, the ethics of creation, and the cyclical patterns of power and belief that repeat across different planes of reality - all against the backdrop of an existential threat that forces beings at every level to confront their place in a harsh and unforgiving cosmos.
