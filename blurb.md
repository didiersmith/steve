We've all heard of "God's plan" and his "mysterious ways," but what does that actually look like? What if God doesn't really know himself?

What if God's just a regular guy with a job he doesn't understand, a boss he doesn't trust, and a co-worker who's trying to sabotage him?

What if God lives in a dystopian totalitarian state and has problems enough of his own?

I am a software engineer working at an AI startup in San Francisco. As we edge towards creating artificial sentient life, many questions are being asked about the ethical and practical implications of creating intelligent beings, including our obligations to them and the risks of them turning on us. Realizing that theologians have struggled with the very same questions for thousands of years, I decided to write The Book of Steve - a literary satirical hard scifi novel, which grapples with timeless questions of morality, power, governance and creation while striking a darkly comedic tone and lampooning every political system under the sun.

The story takes place across two universes - that of the creator (a bumbling academic named Steve), and that of his creation (our world). We follow a number of human characters as they split off from contemporary society to create their own experimental communities in the Pacific Ocean. Unfortunately, things go pear-shaped, characters die and end up resurrected in Steve's world, and the lines between the universes become blurred as the original characters' children continue their original missions.

I started writing this book in June 2024 on my daily commute (I take the train in to work). I have just finished my first draft, and although I am already aware of many changes I would like to make, I'd love the input of a more experienced editor to help me develop the structure. It is an ambitious work with an unusual narrative structure, so I would really love help to ensure that it "works". My budget is flexible.

In the beginning, Steve created the universe. What started as a hobby becomes his people's best chance for survival against an existential alien threat.

It started as a hobby, but an existential alien risk brings a ruthless billionaire into his office with a plan: To breed and align a warfaring bloodthirsty AI inside the sim.

Down in Steve's universe, a history unfolds not unlike our own. A meme competition is declared to align the AIs. Steve enters the ring, and although his meme does well, he somehow finds himself on the back foot. He decides to cheat. Selecting three AIs and granting them privileged access to the world, his intervention sets off a chaotic series of events with lethal implications across our world, and his own.
