# Overview

Set in The Great Peace. A hundred thousand years has passed since the eradication of war.

Steve is a grad student, tinkerer, created Tier 1, invented sexual reproduction (allow the beings to be their own fitness function) - enables much, much faster evolution than in Tier 0, and in any other sim.

Steve's society is nihlistic - they exist for the sake of existing. They do things for the sake of amusement. Steve creates Artificial General Intelligence in his universe, and no one really cares. Steve also doesn't really see the implications, just likes to hang out in VR with his beings and talk with them.

They survive, happily, until one day, Sirius goes dark. It turns out that this has been happening for some time, but no one has ever considered the implications. The only explanation they can come up with is that a dyson sphere has been constructed around it. Some lifeform is roaming around, devouring stars. Steve's people must fight or eventually die.

Unfortunately: Violence, warfare, cunning, etc have been fully eradicated from Steve's people.

The council determines a plan - piggyback off Steve's research to breed a warfaring superintelligence to fight on their behalf.

# Worlds

## Tier 0 (the world Steve lives in)

For the most part, this universe obeys Newtonian physics.

Light is particles and obeys Newtonian physics.
Steve's people don't reproduce sexually, they clone themselves.
Technology level has been pretty much static for the entire Great Peace - no incentive to innovate, Steve is a bit abnormal

## Tier 1 (the world Russell lives in, ie. our world)

- Runs inside a Tier 0 computer, in a fork of Surreal Engine 9
- Many hacks - eg. maximum speed, minimum distance
- High stochasticity in the world - eg. solar flares, meteors, volcanoes, storms, disease - all to increase mutation rate and natural selection

# Characters

- Steve: God, created the universe for fun and interest, fairly pacifist
- Gabe: God's best friend/sidekick, thinks sexual reproduction is unstable, but he is loyal and helpful. Astronomer.
- Declan Murdoch - conceives the idea of breeding the War Intelligence.
- Russell - Computer programmer, programmed his 3D printer to play FPS's
- Stacy - Instagram wellness influencer, pretends to be mentally ill, mostly just nihlistic and lost, becomes queen of one of Russell's fiefdoms
- Maurice Allen - CEO of Eternal Spring (life extension), monopolist, secretly wants to dominate the world but is kept in check by other billionnaires.

# Plot

- Steve creates the world
- Dyson People are discovered, Steve's People send a message saying hi!
- Dyson People are like the Mongols of space, respond with a deal: Either pay a tax, or be expunged from the universe.
- Great debate ensues within Steve's society. Most people just want to pay the tax. A small number of outliers, Steve excluded, believe they should fight.
- Pro-tax arguments:
  - Go along to get along
  - No way they could ever win a fight
- Pro-fighting arguments:

  - Taxation will escalate: Once you've paid the danegeld you will never get rid of the Dane!

- The council can't come to an agreement, Councilmember Perry given freedom and a budget to create the War Intelligence.
- Perry approaches Steve and convinces him to use his universe as the breeding ground for the War Intellect Collective
- Competition kicks off, thousands of initial contestants
- Goal: A set of aligned intelligences who are bred for war, take over the planet but aligned to Steve's people
- Constraints: Interventions cost credits, invisible interventions (eg. speaking into one's head, healing) are very cheap, anything that involves rendering is very expensive, credits accrue at 1024/epoch initially, rate halves every 500 epochs.
- Steve is analagous to Jehovah, picks a small, highly intelligent subset, keeps them insular
- Continously gets beaten by Allen
- Realizes: Ideas stronger than people, spread faster, violent conquest leads to unstable results, have to get people to want to be ruled. Spends all his intervention credits (and borrows more) creating an in-world avatar to appeal not just to his tribe, but to everyone.
- Need to create a warfaring mythos
- This sets off a 2000 epoch arc, his idea becomes the most powerful in the world, but starts to eat itself. Liberalism erupts. People become obsessed with studying the sim itself.
- Skip to near future. Society is increasingly nihlistic. Steve needs to intervene again.
- Identify a subset of society who spend all day practicing simulated warfare (CoD), selects Russell due to his impressive score. Unfortunately Russell is actually cheating.
- Appears to Russell through his computer
- Guides Russell to create a superintelligence to augment his own warfaring instincts
- Wants Russell to take over the world, Russell has different ideas
- Reasons that expansion is the only way to know peace, uses his superintelligence to create new worlds in space.
- Russell is caught between Dyson's philospohy (expansion as a path to peace) and Steve's philosophy (restraint as a path to peace), but ultimately neither are in his nature - his nature is warfare as a path to greatness.
- Russell considers warfare tactics:
  - Dismantling the state via targeted assasination
    - Con: Most people don't have the appetite for greatness
  - Build parallel society with only the most motivated people
- Russell and Steve have increasingly in-depth conversations, over time Russell starts to change Steve and vice versa.
- Eventually, we find out that the government in Steve's world is oppressing them, Russell helps enlighten Steve

- World is running on "particle computers" - state cannot be directly observed, can be moved but not copied. Heisenberg. Zero copy.
  - Characters can be moved between sims, but cannot be copied.

# War in New Sealand

- Vincent -> Xavier
- Stacy -> Stacy II
- Russell -> Filbert

- Russell & Filbert are in exile, living with Stacy
- Stacy II and Filbert hate each other
- People's Republicans protest, want Russell extradited (turns out this protest was staged by dodgy state actors, all of the PR is controlled by the IC, journalists, academia, civil service)
- Eventually, PR declares war, partners with pro-democracy forces in Theocratic Dominion. TD totally unprepared for war.
- Forces storm the palace, capture Stacy I & Russell, Stacy II & Filbert flee via Xavier's Ketzel to New Australia, Xavier and Vincent share Vincent's ketzel back to Anarchy
- Stacy beheaded
- Russell captured, tortured, on deathbed prays to Steve to turn off the computer
- PR subjugates TD
- Stacy II and Filbert explore New Australia
  - Nomadic animal herders, settled pastoralists, raiding bands
- Filbert eventually grows to recognize dangers of democracy, pledges alleigance to Stacy II. Together they unify the tribes of New Australia, promise them citizenship in return for helping them to take back the TD

# War in Steve's world

- Vincent and Russell help Murdoch figure out physics, design warships
- Armada takes off, sends Russell ahead as scout
- Russell gets captured, captors are the same species as Steve, Murdoch etc (Gods), notices that there are female Gods
- Turns out, Steve's world is a penal colony, Murdoch and Allen are prisoners, supposed to have died out a long time ago but they took over a research base on the planet, figured out life extension and asexual reproduction
- Murdoch and Allen have been dying to get off the planet, but didn't have interstellar travel worked out
- Dyson spheres are being used to re-compress photons back into hydrogen to fuel interstellar ships
- Can be used as weapons by rotating mirrors to point at enemy ship
- Are also used to heat / cool planets, renders more of solar system habitable
- There is a war going on, The Rotarians vs The Hell's Angels
- Russell is captured by a smaller force (free statists?) who just want to be left alone
- Russell promises them that the armada could be used to help them win the war, they agree, give him access to comms equipment
- Comms includes codebook, they never figured out public-key encryption
- Dyson spheres are controlled by encrypted protocol that can be hacked if correct codebook is obtained
- Russell & captors embark on mission to capture correct codebook
- Armada starts fighting, war ensues
- Russell's capture of codebook turns the tide, but at great cost, dyson sphere rendered inoperable, people start to freeze
- After armada just barely wins, they're double-crossed by Allen, almost annihilated
- After Allen wins, double-crossed again by Russell's captors
- Eventually, Russell, Vincent, Stacy, Steve escape with StevieNix, found a planet for themselves

# Themes

- Centralizing and decentralizing military technology
- Warfaring mythology
